                    My friends call me Jay. I was born in Shanghai. I lived
                    there until I was 15 years old. Then I moved to Hong Kong.
                    I’m married and I have two kids.

                    I have a lot of friends in Hong Kong, but my close friends
                    are in Shanghai. I go back to Shanghai once a year to see
                    them.

                    I majored in Engineering in university. I work for an
                    electronics company now. I am pretty busy during the week,
                    but on weekends I like to play tennis. I’m a really good
                    tennis player.
