                    At TRITEC, we mainly have two types of customers. These are electronic stores and corporations. Both
                    are important customers because they make up most of our sales at TRITEC.

                    Electronic stores buy products from us and sell them to consumers at their stores. Corporations buy
                    products from TRITEC for their employees to use for business.

                    I can’t tell you the name, but our biggest client is a discount electronics company. They have over
                    200 stores in China. They sell all kinds of electronics, such as computers, cameras, TVs, and so on.
                    I hope we can reach out to other Asian countries soon, such as Malaysia and Singapore.
