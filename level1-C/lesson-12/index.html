                  <p>I’m a member of a new project. The goal of the project is to open TRITEC’s first overseas office. We have a small budget and a tight deadline.</p>

                  <p>I’m working with two other colleagues on this project. We need to do market research in several countries and make a recommendation to our boss by next week.</p>

                    We all have different opinions. I think we should open an office in Turkey because rent and labor costs are low. However, the other project members think the first office should be
                    in Singapore. They thought it’d be easier for TRITEC to expand to other countries in Asia.
