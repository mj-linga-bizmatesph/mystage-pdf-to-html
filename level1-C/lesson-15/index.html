                    TRITEC gets about 2,000 applicants each year. Most of them are new graduates. However, some already have impressive work experiences and skills. My company is always looking for
                    global-minded people.

                    There are three steps in our hiring process. First, applicants must take a written test. Second is an interview with the HR manager. The final step is an interview with a division
                    manager.

                    I applied to TRITEC about five years ago. The written test and the first interview were not so difficult. However, the interview with the division manager was very difficult. I’m
                    really surprised I passed the interview and got the job.
