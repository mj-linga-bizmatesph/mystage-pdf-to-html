                    My colleagues and I are very close. We often talk about many things during lunch. I’m ashamed to say
                    this, but we usually talk about people we don’t like.

                    I heard that my boss, George, may be transferred next year. I’m happy to hear the news because I
                    don’t get along with him so much. My other colleagues are happy, too, but they’re more worried about
                    our next boss, Sandy.
