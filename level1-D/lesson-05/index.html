                    The facilities at TC Com are very good. On the first floor, we have a cafeteria and a lobby. The
                    lobby is the most beautiful area because this is where we receive our guests.

                    On the second floor, we have a first aid room with a company nurse. We also have a smoking area
                    there. There’s an executive lounge for the directors on the top floor.

                    I’m very happy about the facilities here at TC Com. However, I would like a better smoking area.
                    It’s quite small and only holds up to ten people. I think TC Com should make it bigger or make
                    another one.
