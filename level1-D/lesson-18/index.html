                  <p>We only had 15 people in IT three years ago, so TC Com started to outsource its IT work to India. Now, IT work is being handled by 100 IT experts.</p>

                    Last year, TC Com also outsourced its call center to a small European company. However, many customers have complained that the call center operators lack information about TC
                    Com’s services. I think more training should be given.
