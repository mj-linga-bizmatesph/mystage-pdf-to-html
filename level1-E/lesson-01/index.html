              P-Chem has three types of managers. First-line managers are responsible for daily operations. They
              work with employees on a day-to-day basis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Middle managers supervise first-line managers. And then, there are top managers who are
              responsible for the company’s overall performance. They have regular meetings for status updates
              and decision-making.
            </p>

              I’m a first-line manager in the finance department at P-Chem Corp. I have 10 people in my team who
              I have a lot of respect for. I listen to my staff members’ concerns. My goal is to hit our targets
              every month by making sure everyone in the team can work comfortably. I feel it is important for
              the manager to give the staff mental support by trusting them.
