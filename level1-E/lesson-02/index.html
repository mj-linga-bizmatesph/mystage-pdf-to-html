                My responsibility is to help my staff work productively. I want them to do more work in less time. So, I
                have made three office rules to achieve this.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, they must set goals every morning. Second, 2PM-3PM is quiet time. So, they must focus only on
                their work. And third, they can’t work overtime unless it is urgent. My trick for being productive is to
                get the hardest task done in the morning.
              </p>

                I’m worried about one of my staff, Tim. He often misses deadlines and has trouble setting daily goals. I
                really want to help him. However, it seems like he wants no help from me. I want him to become more
                open-minded, so I give him regular feedback.
