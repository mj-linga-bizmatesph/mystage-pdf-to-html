              As a manager, I need to check my staff’s performance. I do this by having one-on-one evaluation
              meetings with each of them twice a year. I check their progress in the middle of the year, and
              then I check their goals again at the end of the year and give them feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
              I ask them these three questions when it’s time to set goals: “Is your goal realistic?” “How will
              it help our customers or the company?” and “What new skills or knowledge will help you achieve
              it?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Tim’s mid-year performance didn’t go well. He failed to achieve some of his goals. I asked him to
              change his goals a little and change his work style. He promised to work more productively to
              achieve his goals at the end of the year.
