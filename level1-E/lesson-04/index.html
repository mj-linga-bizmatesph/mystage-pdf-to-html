              I work in the finance department, so my team needs to create the monthly income statement for
              P-Chem Corp. It’s also called the profit and loss statement or P&L statement.
            </p>
            <p>
              The P&L statement explains the company’s revenues, costs, and profit or loss. All the managers
              look at the P&L statement to see the company’s performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Last year, our revenues were very good, but costs were very high. So, our profits were small. Two
              years ago, P-Chem had a loss, but things are getting better. This year, we are trying to cut
              costs, so I think the company will perform well financially.
