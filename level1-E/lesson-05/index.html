              Recently, there have been many changes in the plastic products industry. There are now many new
              Chinese competitors. They sell their products at much lower prices than P-Chem, so we need to
              communicate the value of our products to our customers better.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another big change is customer needs. Customers have begun to take more notice of design and not
              just quality. The board of directors are now discussing how P-Chem should adapt to this change.
            </p>

              We will use a new computer system starting next year in the finance department. However, some
              people are not looking forward to the change. They like the system they are using now. They are
              afraid that the new system will slow down their work.
