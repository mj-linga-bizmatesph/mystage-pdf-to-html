              I would like to hire a new person in the marketing department. The employee should have good
              computer skills, communication skills, and of course, web marketing skills. By good communication
              skills, I mean being able to share ideas with the team, understand our product’s value well and
              communicate it to our customers effectively.
            </p>

              From my experience, good marketers have good people skills. They are interested in people, and
              like to meet and listen to others. It’s important because they need to know how people think and
              behave on the Internet. I don’t have great people skills, but I think I’ve become better with
              people over the past few years.
