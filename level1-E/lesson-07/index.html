                A new employee started last week. Her name is Jenny. She’s young and doesn’t have much experience in
                marketing. There are many things I would like to train Jenny on.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, Jenny will learn the department rules. Then, little by little, I will teach her the basics of
                marketing. Then, I will ask one of the senior staff members to train her.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition, I would like to give training on liberal arts to all of my staff in the marketing
                department. So, I contacted the HR manager to ask about workshops available for them. My staff members
                are very excited and signed up for some workshops.
