                I’m the only decision-maker in my team. Decisions like scheduling meetings are easy. However, some
                decisions are more difficult, like deciding who to assign to a project.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I’m unsure about what to do, I talk to my boss or other colleagues about it. However, I don’t
                always follow their advice. Sometimes I just go with what I feel is right.
              </p>

                I need to make a difficult decision soon. I’m very unhappy with Jenny’s performance. She often fails to
                meet expectations. I already talked to her about it. If I see no improvement in the next two weeks, I
                will have to let her go.
