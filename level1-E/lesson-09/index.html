              I’ve been a manager for a year but I need to learn to be a leader more. Some of my colleagues have
              taken an MBA, so my boss has recommended me to try it, too. But I don’t think you can study to be
              a good leader.
            </p>
            <p>
              Maybe what I need to do is work with a great leader. I have met a person like that before. She had
              a great personality, great listening skills and a very open mind. Talking with her made me feel
              important because she really listened to me. So when she gave me advice, I listened carefully,
              too.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m so motivated to learn more about leadership. I recently read a book about a famous business
              leader. According to him, leaders are not born, but they are created through self-study and
              experience.
