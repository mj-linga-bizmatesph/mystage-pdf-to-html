                P-Chem has a kitchenware brand called P-WARE. P-WARE products include silverware, pans, espresso
                machines and more.
              </p>
              <p>
                The brand is known for having a simple and elegant design. Its main target is young families, but it is
                also popular among young single women in their 30’s.
              </p>
              <p>
                I think many people like the brand because its products are so durable. P-WARE products can be used for
                a long time, so they easily become part of people’s lives. I think that’s why P-WARE is so popular.
