              Reporting information is something that every businessperson has to do. I report to my direct boss
              and also managers of some other departments because I’m part of a few project teams.
            </p>
            <p>
              Project members report to leaders on the status of a project. Managers report to executives on
              business performance. The sales department shares their weekly report with my department.
            </p>
            <p>
              I need to report the company’s financial performance to my boss. I need to include key financial
              information, such as sales, costs, and profit. I will also give my opinion and make
              recommendations in my report.
