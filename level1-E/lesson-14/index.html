                P-Chem’s corporate vision is simple. We want to give convenience to our customers through plastic
                products in an eco-friendly society.

                Our products can be used over and over, so they are environmentally friendly. P-Chem’s products, such as
                kitchenware and stationery, make daily life easier for our customers.

                Our president often makes announcements to remind employees of the corporate vision. Managers and their
                staff also need to set goals that support our vision. So I always tell my team that it’s very important
                to think about the vision.
