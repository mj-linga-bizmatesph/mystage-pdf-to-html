              <p>P-Chem spends a lot of money on advertising each year. P-Chem uses advertising to build its brand and to attract new customers.</p>
              <p>P-Chem’s products are mostly purchased by women, so the company advertises in women’s magazines, on the Internet, and by direct mail.</p>
              <p>
                One of our most effective advertising methods is direct mail. We send pamphlets with coupons to customers. The pamphlet explains the kinds of products P-Chem has. Customers can get a
                small discount when they use the coupon to buy P-Chem’s products.
