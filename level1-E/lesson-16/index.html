              I’ve set up many processes for my team. There’s a process for writing a report, taking a day off,
              booking a meeting room, and so on. We need these processes to keep work efficient.
            </p>
            <p>
              If someone wants to take some time off, he or she needs to fill out a form. The employee needs to
              write down the reason for taking time off, too. Then, the employee needs to give at least a
              one-week notice for approval so that I can check the calendar.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most people think this process is fair, but I’m starting to feel that writing the reason down is
              unnecessary. My staff work too hard, so I want them to use their paid vacation days more. They may
              take time off more often if I don’t ask them the reason.
