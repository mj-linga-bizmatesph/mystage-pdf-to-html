              <p>At P-Chem, when business is good, the company has extra cash. P-Chem gives this extra money to employees through benefits or bonuses.</p>
              <p>We sometimes make expensive purchases, like equipment and facilities. Also, P-Chem often re-invests its profits in staff training.</p>
              <p>
                On the other hand, P-Chem needs to cut costs when business is bad. We usually do an audit to see where money is being spent. Then, executives ask department heads to reduce their
                costs. Right now, my company is eager to cut costs. The most common cost cutting activity is reducing overtime work.
