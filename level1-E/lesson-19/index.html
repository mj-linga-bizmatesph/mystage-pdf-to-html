              <p>P-Chem Corp wants its employees to be happy. The company believes that happy workers will work harder, take fewer sick days, and stay longer with the company.</p>
              <p>P-Chem encourages its employees to avoid overtime work unless it’s necessary. This way, employees would have more time for themselves, their families and their friends.</p>
              <p>
                I work hard during the day so that I can finish my work early. I usually go to the gym on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. On weekends, I usually meet with my friends or just take it
                easy at home. I really like how P-Chem promotes work-life balance.
