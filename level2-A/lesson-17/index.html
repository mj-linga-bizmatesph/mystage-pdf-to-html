              Our <u>employees are product-minded, so</u> we care about quality and perfection. We have many
              rules and we are very careful not to make mistakes. We have a process for everything.

            <p>Taro:</p>
            <p>
              It is, but I think it’s necessary to make top quality products. Another unique characteristic is
              that <u>we are like a family business</u>. Everyone has met the president and most people stay
              with MMB for their entire career.
