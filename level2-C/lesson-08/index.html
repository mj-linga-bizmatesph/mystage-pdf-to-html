                I see. We plan to make around 2000 copies each month. This would
                exceed our monthly budget of 20,000 yen. Would a long-term
                contract reduce the monthly costs?

                Well, if you can agree to a 2-year contract, I might be able to
                reduce it a little. But I need to get approval.

            Before negotiating terms of a lease with your business partner,

            <li>
              In what situations do you have to negotiate with a business
