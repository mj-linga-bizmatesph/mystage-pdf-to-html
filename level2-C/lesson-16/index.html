            <p>Dear Mr. Lee,</p>
            <p>It was a pleasure meeting you at Korean Auto Systems today. I was very impressed with your company’s new
              car model and hope that we can somehow be a part of it. </p>
            <p>Here are the specifications of our Halogen-free wires. I’ll be sure to send you an estimate by July 16.
            </p>
            <p>Please let me know if there’s any other information you need from us.</p>
