                   <p> So, I immediately called the shipping department, and had them deliver the correct order the next day. I went to the client’s office on that day to apologize and to explain the problem. </p>

                   <p>Taro:</p>
                   <p>Of course they were upset at first, but they appreciated our quick response. And they seemed happy to receive a 10% discount on their next order.</p>
