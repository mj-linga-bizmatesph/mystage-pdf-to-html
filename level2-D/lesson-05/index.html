              OK, I’ll do that later. It was a bit of a waste of time. I presented our sales strategy and some
              people asked me some questions. And then, we went out for dinner.

              Don, thank you for approving my trip to Shanghai. It was really productive. By the way, I brought
              back some sweets for everyone.

              Sure. I made my presentation three times. First, to all the salespeople, then, one-on-one to the
              sales manager, and finally to some of their vendors.

              Overall, they seemed impressed with our plan. Some asked good questions, which I couldn’t answer.
              So, I’m putting together an FAQ sheet now. But the best thing is that I really connected with the
              local salespeople. I’m going to keep in touch with them.
