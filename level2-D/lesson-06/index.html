              Don, yes you did. And I’m sorry I didn’t follow through with your request. When I had a meeting
              with Kenji before the sales call to explain the contract, he seemed really nervous. So, I
              determined that he wasn’t ready to go.

              I know. You specifically asked me to do something, and I didn’t do it. That was wrong of me. So,
              I’m going to do some training with Kenji tomorrow so that he’ll be ready for the next visit.
