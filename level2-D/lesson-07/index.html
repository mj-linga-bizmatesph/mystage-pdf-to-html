              Well, I’m having a little trouble training Kenji. I know Kenji’s trying hard, but he still has
              problems explaining our products clearly.

          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Don:</p>
            <p>That’s a really difficult skill.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Taro:</p>
            <p>
              I know. But now, when I give him some advice, he gets very defensive. I don’t know what I’m doing
              wrong. I really want to help him, but I don’t know how.
            </p>

              Well, this is your first time training someone, so it’s natural to have some difficulties. Let’s
              look at some ways to more effectively give feedback.
