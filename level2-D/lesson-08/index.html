                When a serious issue like harassment occurs, it’s important to report all the facts, including <span class="red">dates</span>, <span class="red">times</span>, and exactly what was
                actually <span class="red">said</span> and <span class="red">done</span>.

                  I see. Don, I did not say such a thing. Yesterday, I had a meeting with Kenji at 1PM to go over his one-month performance. I told him that his skills were getting better, but we
                  needed to see results. He asked me if he would get fired if he didn’t make a sale soon. And I said we would evaluate his performance at the end of September.
