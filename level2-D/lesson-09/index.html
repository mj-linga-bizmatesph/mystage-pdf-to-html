                 <p>Don:</p>
                 <p> Well, for several reasons. His sales performance is poor, he’s been late, and you gave him a poor evaluation. </p>

                 <p>Taro:</p>
                 <p>Didn’t he miss his target by only 15%? Last quarter was bad for all the salespeople.</p>

                 <p>Taro:</p>
                 <p>Well, he’s still young. And he had a proper reason for being late.</p>

                 <p>Don:</p>

                 <p>Taro:</p>
                 <p> Kenji still has many areas to improve, but I mentioned in my evaluation that he has potential. So, if the main reason is because of my evaluation, I think there is a misunderstanding. </p>
