              I’ve worked really hard this year, but I’m still 30% behind my target. It’s impossible to reach.

              Don, I’m sorry to bother you, but could I talk to you about something that I’m a little

              Well, I’ve managed to get several new contracts this year, but I’ve lost two big contracts which
              were out of my control. And because of that, I’m still 30% behind my target.

            <p>Taro:</p>

              I’ve committed to my sales target,
              <u>so I want to do everything that I can to reach it before requesting a revision</u>.

              You’ve got the right attitude, Taro. Let’s talk about some things we can do to help you reach your
              goals. If it’s still looking unrealistic, we can request lowering them a little.
