              <p class="text"> A goodbye is never really final. You never know when you’ll work with them again. So, try to <span class="red">keep in touch</span> with important connections. </p>

              <p class="text second-text"> It’s often difficult to know what to say to someone who is leaving the company. One common approach is to recall an <span class="red">event</span> you shared, show <span class="red">appreciation</span> and exchange <span class="red">contact information</span>. </p>
