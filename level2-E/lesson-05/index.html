            When training someone, rather than saying,<br>
            <span class="i">“I will show you …”,</span> <span class="red">say</span>

            One effective method of training is to ask for the trainee’s <span class="red">knowledge</span> and <span

              First, you need to know the customer’s needs. So, you need to put that here.

              <span>Today, we’re going to look at putting proposals together.</span>
              Could you tell me how you put proposals together in China?

          <div class="row">
            <p>David:</p>
            <p>Yes, we always start with an introduction of our company. Many people in China don’t know MMB, so we
              explain the company history and introduce our product line. Then, we summarize the customer’s needs,
              explain our solution, and end with pricing.

          <div class="row">
            <p>Taro:</p>
            <p>OK, that’s very good. We try to make the client’s needs the main message. </p>

          <div class="row">
            <p>David:</p>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Taro:</p>
            <p>No, not our solution. If we can show the client that we truly understand their needs, they will read our
              solution. If they don’t think we understand, they won’t read our proposal. </p>
