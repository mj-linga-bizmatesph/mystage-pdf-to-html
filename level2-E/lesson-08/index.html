            Dealing with conflict between people is a very sensitive issue. Rather than <span class="red">accusing</span> someone, 
            <span class="red">ask what happened.</span>

            When dealing with conflict, it’s more effective to <span class="red">elicit a course of action</span> from the other person than to tell them what they should do.

            <p>Yeah, before our meeting, we were all joking and having fun. And then, during our meeting, when Taka made a comment, I jokingly said his idea was silly. And Taka suddenly turned red and stopped participating in the meeting. </p>
