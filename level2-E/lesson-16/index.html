            <p>Hi, everyone. I have an important announcement. We will switch to a new customer database system starting September 1. This is a global decision, so please follow the new system starting next month. You will need to input new customer data into the system. If you don’t understand, please come to me.</p>

                Hi, everyone. I have an important announcement. For the last two months, Tony has been working on a project to create a global customer database. Well, it’s now complete, and we will be switching to this new system starting September 1. 
              </span>
              <span>
                So, how will this affect you? We just need everyone to input new customer data into the system. The categories are listed on your handout. 
              </span>
              <span>
                So, why did we change to this new system? Well, starting next month, you can get all the customers’ information from the system so you don’t have to contact offices overseas to share or get information. This will save you time and trouble and we hope it will improve collaboration with offices overseas. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me anytime.
