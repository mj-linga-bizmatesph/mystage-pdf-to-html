                Time management is a <span class="red">skill</span>. It’s how effectively you can manage your time to get work done. It means focusing on the <span class="red">results</span> rather
                than your <span class="red">tasks</span>.

                The first step to developing time management skills is to
                <span class="red"> understand how effectively you manage your time</span>.

                <p>Frank, I’ve just been assigned as Project Manager. However, we have a really tight schedule. Do you have any tools I can use to manage my time effectively?</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Frank :</p>
                <p>Sure, but before you use any tools, you need to develop your time management skills.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Yasu :</p>
                <p>What do you mean?</p>

              <div class="row">
                <p>Frank :</p>
                <p>Well, time management is a skill. It’s how effectively you can manage your time to get work done. It means focusing on getting results rather than just managing tasks.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Yasu :</p>
                <p>And how can I develop this skill?</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Frank :</p>
                <p>Well, I suggest you keep an activity log to understand how you manage your time. It’s like a record of how much time you spend on each task.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Yasu :</p>
                <p>You mean like a timesheet?</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Frank :</p>
                <p>
                  A timesheet is for the company. An activity log is for yourself. Keep a record of what you do, when you do it, how much time you spend on it, how you feel when you do it, and the
                  value of the task. That’ll really show you how you manage your time.

                <p>OK, I’ll try that. Thanks.</p>
