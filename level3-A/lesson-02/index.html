              Frank, I’ve been keeping an Activity Log for a week now, and I’m
              beginning to see how I’m wasting time on tasks that don’t
              contribute to results.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              Exactly. Now, your next step is to change this behavior.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>How do I do that?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>First, you can prepare a To-Do list.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              OK, that’s easy. It’s just a list of things I need to do, right?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              Well, that’s only the first step. Next, you need to prioritize
              based on two factors: impact and time.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              I see. So I should focus on the tasks that have the biggest impact
              and take the least amount of time. Got it. What else?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              Well, I noticed that when I ask you for a file, it takes you a
              long time to find it. Maybe you need to better organize your
              files.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>Yeah, I know that’s a weakness of mine.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              OK, here are some basic rules for filing. Have a folder each for
              ongoing work and completed work. That’ll clear your desktop
              immediately. Also keep related documents together, and keep file
              titles consistent. It’ll be easier to find files with your search
              feature on your PC. And finally, save just what you need.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>That makes sense. This will make it easier to multitask.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              One more thing, don’t multitask. People with good time management
              skills don’t multitask. They might manage several projects or
              assignments, but they complete each task one at a time.
