                <p>Frank, I feel so stressed out with this project. I don’t know how much pressure I can take. I’m really not sure what to do.</p>

                <p>Frank:</p>
                <p>Well Yasu, stress management is a skill. And as you learned with time management, there are some tools and habits that can help you develop this skill.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Yasu:</p>
                <p>So, what do I need to do?</p>

                <p>Frank:</p>
                <p>
                  The first step is to understand what’s causing you stress and how you are dealing with it. It might not be from one source. Is it the tight deadlines? Is it trying to please your
                  boss? Is it a particular project member?
                </p>

                <p>Yasu:</p>
                <p>I think it’s all those things.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Frank:</p>
                <p>Well, it helps to know what it is and how you are reacting to it.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Yasu:</p>
                <p>And how do I figure that out?</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Frank:</p>
                <p>One thing you can do is to keep a Stress Diary.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Yasu:</p>
                <p>A Stress Diary? That sounds so childish.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Frank:</p>
                <p>Sure, but it’s similar to the Activity Log that you kept to develop your time management skills. It just means recording cases of stress that you have.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Yasu:</p>
                <p>You mean I record the details when I’m stressed.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Frank:</p>
                <p>That’s right. Record the stressful event, your level of stress, and your reaction. After a while, you’ll start to better understand what the biggest source of stress is for you.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Yasu:</p>
                <p>OK, I’ll try that. Thanks.</p>
