                Frank, the Stress Diary you suggested is helping a lot. I’m beginning to see patterns in my behavior.

                Excellent. Understanding yourself is the first step. Now you can pick up some tools and habits to help you manage stress.

            <div class="row">

              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>Well, once the source of your stress is clear, it’s easier to take action. If it’s tight deadlines, you can develop your time management skills. If it’s another member, you can talk to the person to resolve any issues.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                What if it’s my personality? You know, I’m a negative thinker.

              <p>Frank:</p>

                Well, we can change that too.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                Really? How?

              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                Well, mental stress often comes from irrational thinking. Let’s look at it together. What are you negative about? 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>Sometimes I feel I don’t have the skills for the job. Or I won’t get the results I want. Or I’ll have problems out of my control.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                If you’re continuously developing your skills for your job, it’s irrational to be stressed out for not having the skills. If you are doing everything you can to achieve results, it’s irrational to worry about not getting results. If you have back-up plans, it’s irrational to worry about things out of your control.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>I guess you’re right. I am doing all those things.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                And don’t forget to have a healthy lifestyle. Sleep, eat, and exercise. Enjoy your personal life as well as your work life.
