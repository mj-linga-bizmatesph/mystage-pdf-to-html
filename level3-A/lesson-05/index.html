              A project manager manages three important

              <p>
                OK, let’s first talk about your role as project manager.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>Sure, I’m like a facilitator, right?</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>You’re a lot more than that. You have complete responsibility for the success of the project. The company is allocating time, money, and people for you to achieve a specific goal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                That’s a lot of pressure. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                Yes, it is. And in the most basic sense, you manage the time, money, and people to ensure the goal is achieved.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                I see. So I basically need to carefully manage these three resources.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                There’s more. The three resources of time, money, and people need to be directly linked to the scope of the project. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>What do you mean by scope?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                The scope is the specific requirements that you are expected to achieve in order for the project to be called a success.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>You mean the goal of the project, right?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                They’re a little different. Let’s say your project goal is to set up a meeting room. Suddenly, your boss changes the scope from 50 people to 500. So, the goal is the same, but the scope has changed. 
              </p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>I think I get it now. Thanks Frank.</p>
