            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              OK, now I understand that as project manager, I need to carefully manage the three resources of time, money, and people. But do you have any practical tips?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              OK, let’s start with time. You can use “3-point estimating” when creating your project schedule.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>What do you mean?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>It just means to create 3 schedules, a worst-case scenario with delays, a best-case with no delays, and a realistic one.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              That makes sense. What about money?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              Well, you need to closely manage your budget. And remember that forecasting is an ongoing process. Continuously reforecast and communicate this to your team.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              Right. The problem is the executives keep making new requests.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              Well, you need to reforecast the budget every time the project scope changes. If your project scope changes, the budget and schedule need to be adjusted too.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>I see. What about communication with my project team?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              One thing that has worked for me is to have daily “scrum meetings”.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>A meeting every day?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              Yes, just 15 minutes to answer 3 questions. What did you do yesterday? What will you do today? And are there any issues? You can do this online or face-to-face.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>I think I get it now. As project manager, I need to be constantly monitoring and making adjustments to the schedule and budget and communicating these to my team.</p>
