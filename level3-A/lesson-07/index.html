              Frank, I’m having trouble with my team. I think the team is
              falling apart.

            <p>
              When we first started the project, everyone was polite and
              respectful. However, now two of the members are always disagreeing
              with each other. Another member keeps challenging me. I think he’s
              trying to take over the project.

          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              Natural progression? We’re making no progress now.
            </p>

            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              Let’s talk about team management, Yasu. You see, there are five
              basic stages a team goes through as it develops.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              What are these stages?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              Well, the first stage is forming. That’s when all the members were
              polite and respectful.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>Right.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              Well, as members get to know each other, they become more direct
              and less careful with their actions. They notice things that they
              like and dislike about others, and conflict occurs.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>Yes, that’s what’s happening now.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              Don’t worry. This is a natural progression of the team. Soon
              they’ll get to the norming stage where they understand and accept
              others for who they are. Then, they’ll move to the performing
              stage. This is when the team performs at its best.
            </p>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>What’s the last stage?</p>

            <p>Frank:</p>
            <p>
              It’s adjourning. This is when the project ends and the team
              disbands.
