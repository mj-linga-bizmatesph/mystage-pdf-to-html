                OK, I now understand that my team is just going through a difficult stage. But is there anything I can do?
              </p>
            </div>

              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                Of course. And as Project Manager, you should do something. A common source of conflict is lack of clarity. What are the rules?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>Rules? We all work for the same company. We all know what the rules are.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>Yes, but you should have your own rules for the project team. Who has responsibility for what? What format is expected? What’s the process? All these things need to be clarified. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                I see. Now that you mention it, I think that’s a big source of the problem. But what if the conflict is personal? Two of the members just hate each other and the others have given up on getting them to work together.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                Well, it’s helpful for all members to understand the 5 stages of the team development process from forming to adjourning. So, explain to them that the team is just going through the storming stage. 
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                That’s a good point. But will they really get along after that?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                Maybe not, but it’ll give the other team members hope and understanding. It takes time to build up teamwork. Another thing you can do is a team-building activity.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>You mean like taking a daytrip somewhere outside the city?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                That could be expensive. It could be as simple as having a team lunch or going out for drinks after work.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>I see. You’ve given me a lot of hope. I’ll try that. Thanks.</p>
