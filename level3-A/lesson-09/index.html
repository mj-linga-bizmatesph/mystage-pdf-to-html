              A personal vision not only gives you
              <span class="red">direction</span> in your life and career, but it
              gives you a measure to <span class="red">evaluate</span> your life

              Just like with any business plan, your career strategy starts with
              an analysis. Use SWOT to analyze your
              <span class="red">Strengths</span>,
              <span class="red">Weaknesses</span>,
              <span class="red">Opportunities</span>, and

                Thanks. I’d like to take on another project soon. I wish the
                company would give me more chances to develop and grow.

              <p>
                Yes, this project was a good opportunity for you. However, your
                development and growth aren’t controlled by the company. That’s
                ultimately controlled by you.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                But I can’t assign myself a project or promote myself to a new
                position. That’s controlled by the company.
              </p>

              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                Yes, maybe so. But the truth is it’s not luck that makes people
                successful. Successful people create those opportunities
                themselves. They manage their own careers.

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>And how do I do that?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>I would start by analyzing myself.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>You mean like my strengths and weaknesses?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                Before that, think about your values and motivators. What do you
                want to achieve in your career? What is success to you?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>Those are tough questions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                Of course. Most of us never think about it. However, those who
                achieve great success have a personal vision. And they
                understand their <u>strengths and weaknesses </u>. They look for
                <u>opportunities </u> and prepare for <u>threats </u>.

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>So they do their own personal SWOT analysis?</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                Yes, that’s right. And they take action. They work on their
                weaknesses and build on their strengths
