                Well, meeting someone for the first time is a very important
                event to the Japanese. So, to show respect to the other person,
                we follow a customary ritual called the meishi koukan or the
                exchanging of business cards.

                When you receive the business card from your client,
                <u>accept it with both hands </u> as you bow
                <u>to show that </u> you are grateful for this opportunity.
                <u>Look it over carefully to show you are </u> interested in
                learning more about the person. Lastly,
                <u>place it on your cardholder </u> on the table
                <u>to show respect </u> to the other person.
