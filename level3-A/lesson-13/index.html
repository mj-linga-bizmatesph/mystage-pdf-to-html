            <p>Yes, that’s right. Their true feelings are called hon-ne. They won’t tell us that.</p>

              I’m not sure about that. You see, in Japan, we have two important concepts, tatemae and hon-ne. 
              Tatemae is acting in a way that will please the other, which is what we do in public. 
              Whereas hon-ne is our true feelings, which we only show to people we completely trust. 
              <u>And that’s why it’s so important to build trust with the client</u>.

              I think so. We won’t know for sure until we can build the relationship to the point that they trust us. 
              <u>But don’t worry. We’ll visit them a few more times and little by little, we’ll be able to see their true feelings</u>.
