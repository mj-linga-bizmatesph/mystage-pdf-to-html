              Although the idea of “<span class="red">the customer is always right</span>” is a 
              common concept in many parts of the world, the Japanese place much greater importance on it.

                Well, in Japanese business, we have a very clear hierarchy, and the customer is 
                at the top of this hierarchy. So, <u>we need to doeverything we can to meet their needs</u>.

            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>I understand that. I’ve attended customer service workshops in the US, and we should do what we can within reason. But this client’s request is unreasonable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Makoto:</p>
              <p>
                Let’s look at it this way: there are many other wiring companies in Japan that would be willing 
                to go the extra mile to meet this client’s request. <u>If we say no to this client</u>, they can very 
                easily find another wiring company. That’s why we need to meet this client’s request.
