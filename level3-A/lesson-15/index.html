              Some people would have difficulty understanding how being open and honest could be seen as disrespectful.

                Well, in Japan we place high importance on respect for our elders. And in this meeting, we’re going to have 
                several senior managers. They will most likely refrain from giving their opinions, but they may make some comments 
                on our ideas. To save face, <u>it’s polite to show agreement</u>, even if we may think that their comments are unjust. 
                <u>We can always express our grievances in private</u>.

              <p>Makoto:</p>
              <p>
                Yes, so the purpose of this meeting is to present our ideas, not to convince them.
                <u>There’s a separate time for that</u>.
