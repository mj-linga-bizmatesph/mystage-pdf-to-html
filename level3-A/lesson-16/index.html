              The real purpose of this drinking party is for the senior managers to get to know us better. 
              In fact, we call it “communication through drinking” or nominication. We feel that business moves 
              much more smoothly when we work with people we know. In a formal business setting like our meeting today, 
              it’s really difficult to break the ice, <u>so this drinking event is achance for us to</u> build a trusting relationship with them. 
              Once we do that, <u>it’ll be much easier</u> to be open and honest with them.
