                  The real purpose of this drinking party is for the senior managers to get to know us better. In fact, we call it “communication through drinking” or nominication. <br />We feel that
                  business moves much more smoothly when we work with people we know. In a formal business setting like our meeting today, it’s really difficult to break the ice,
                  <u>so this drinking event is achance for us to</u> build a trusting relationship with them.<br />
                  Once we do that, <u>it’ll be much easier</u> to be open and honest with them.
