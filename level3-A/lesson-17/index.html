                  Well, we have a hierarchical corporate structure that’s <u>based on consensus and cooperation</u>. <br />
                  So, instead of the president making all the key decisions, the directors are involved in the decision-making process, and each of these directors has gathered input from their
                  managers who have also heard from first-line employees. <u>So, everyone is involved directly or indirectly in making decisions</u>.

                <p>Frank:</p>
                <p>That’s involvement by a lot of people.</p>

                <p>Makoto:</p>
                <p>Yes, but the benefit is that once a decision is made, <u>everyone is 100% committed</u> to carrying it out.</p>
