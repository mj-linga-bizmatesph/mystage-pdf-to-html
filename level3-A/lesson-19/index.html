                The term “<span class="red">workaholic</span>” is often viewed negatively. So, instead, give a logical answer to explain why the Japanese have so much loyalty to the company.

                  <u>Although it’s changing with the younger generation</u>, you’re right. You see, the company you work for has a lot of influence on how you are viewed by society. Your company name
                  is important when you apply for a loan, when you rent an apartment, and even when your child applies to a private school.

                <p>Makoto:</p>
                <p>Maybe so, but I think that’s a big reason we are so loyal to our company. <u>If the company performs well</u>, all its employees will benefit in one way or another.</p>
