                A problem-solving tool called
                <span class="red">Simplex Process</span>, developed by Min
                Basadur, uses an 8-stage cycle, which is more effective than the
                usual linear process.

              <p>Jerry:</p>
              <p>So Tomo, how’s your new position as manager?</p>

              <p>Tomo:</p>
              <p>
                Good, I guess. It’s been a month since I got promoted to the
                position, but our team performance hasn’t improved.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Jerry:</p>
              <p>What’s the problem?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Tomo:</p>
              <p>
                The problem is that there are no problems. Everything is going
                smoothly but we’re not getting the results we want.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Jerry:</p>
              <p>
                Well, I want to teach something that’ll change your perception
                on what problem solving really is.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Tomo:</p>
              <p>What do you mean?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Jerry:</p>
              <p>
                You see, the problem solving process doesn’t start with a
                problem. It starts with actively searching for problems. Let me
                show you what this process looks like:
              </p>
            </div>
            <img
              alt="cycle"
              src="https://lesson-materials.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/images/03-B-cycle.png"
              class="shape"
            />
            <div class="row">
              <p>Tomo:</p>
              <p>I see. So it’s an 8-stage cycle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Jerry:</p>
              <p>
                That’s right. Many people see problem solving as a linear
                process of identifying the problem, brainstorming options, and
                implementing the best solution. However, this cycle shows that
                problem solving is a continuous process.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Tomo:</p>
              <p>
                I understand. So this approach opens more room for fine-tuning
                any implemented solution for problems in the future, correct?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Jerry:</p>
              <p>
                Yes, Tomo. It can be used to solve problems of any scale too.
                Let’s go through each step of the problem-solving cycle.
