              A problem-solving tool called <span class="red">Simplex Process</span>, developed by Min Basadur,
              uses an 8-stage cycle, which is more effective than the usual linear process.

          <div class="row">
            <p>Tomo:</p>
            <p>
              Good, I guess. It’s been a month since I got promoted to the position, but our team performance
              hasn’t improved.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Jerry:</p>
            <p>What’s the problem?</p>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Tomo:</p>
            <p>
              The problem is that there are no problems. Everything is going smoothly but we’re not getting the
              results we want.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Jerry:</p>
            <p>
              Well, I want to teach something that’ll change your perception on what problem solving really is.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Tomo:</p>
            <p>What do you mean?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Jerry:</p>
            <p>
              You see, the problem solving process doesn’t start with a problem. It starts with actively
              searching for problems. Let me show you what this process looks like:
            </p>
          </div>
          <img class="shape" alt="cycle" src="/images/03-B-cycle.png" />
          <div class="row">
            <p>Tomo:</p>
            <p>I see. So it’s an 8-stage cycle.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Jerry:</p>
            <p>
              That’s right. Many people see problem solving as a linear process of identifying the problem,
              brainstorming options, and implementing the best solution. However, this cycle shows that problem
              solving is a continuous process.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Tomo:</p>
            <p>
              I understand. So this approach opens more room for fine-tuning any implemented solution for
              problems in the future, correct?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Jerry:</p>
            <p>
              Yes, Tomo. It can be used to solve problems of any scale too. Let’s go through each step of the
              problem-solving cycle.
