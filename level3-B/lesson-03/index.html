                Fact-finding isn’t just about looking for data. It’s also about researching and understanding the problem as

                <p>Jerry:</p>
                <p>The next step in the cycle is to do fact-finding.</p>

              <div class="row">
                <p>Tomo:</p>
                <p>Sure. So I should get some data and look at the figures carefully, right?</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Jerry:</p>
                <p>Yes, figures will allow you to confirm whether something really is a problem or not. But that’s not enough to identify the problem.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Tomo:</p>

              <div class="row">
                <p>Jerry:</p>
                <p>Fact-finding isn’t just about looking at data. You need to consider all the other factors involved.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Tomo:</p>
                <p>Like what?</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Jerry:</p>
                <p>Well, look at the problem from other perspectives. Speak to people. What do your team members think? What do your customers or end users think?</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Tomo:</p>
                <p>OK, I can get some feedback from them.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Jerry:</p>
                <p>There’s more. How do your competitors deal with this? What ideas have been tried in the past? Could the processes, systems, and technologies you are using be changed?</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Tomo:</p>
                <p>Wow, that’s a lot of research.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="row">
                <p>Jerry:</p>
                <p>
                  Of course. Properly doing fact-finding will save you a lot of time later on. And the most important thing you need to figure out is whether fixing this problem is really worth the
                  effort you are putting in.
