            Fact-finding isn’t just about looking for data. It’s also about researching and understanding the

          <div class="row">
            <p>Jerry:</p>
            <p>The next step in the cycle is to do fact-finding.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Tomo:</p>
            <p>Sure. So I should get some data and look at the figures carefully, right?</p>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Jerry:</p>
            <p>
              Yes, figures will allow you to confirm whether something really is a problem or not. But that’s
              not enough to identify the problem.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Tomo:</p>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Jerry:</p>
            <p>
              Fact-finding isn’t just about looking at data. You need to consider all the other factors
              involved.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Tomo:</p>
            <p>Like what?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Jerry:</p>
            <p>
              Well, look at the problem from other perspectives. Speak to people. What do your team members
              think? What do your customers or end users think?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Tomo:</p>
            <p>OK, I can get some feedback from them.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Jerry:</p>
            <p>
              There’s more. How do your competitors deal with this? What ideas have been tried in the past?
              Could the processes, systems, and technologies you are using be changed?.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Tomo:</p>
            <p>Wow, that’s a lot of research.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Jerry:</p>
            <p>
              Of course. Properly doing fact-finding will save you a lot of time later on. And the most
              important thing you need to figure out is whether fixing this problem is really worth the effort
              you are putting in.
