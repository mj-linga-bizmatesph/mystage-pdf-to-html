              <p>
                OK, but don’t forget that your goal isn’t just to explain your idea, it’s to get approval. In
                other words, you need to sell your idea.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Tomo:</p>

                Well, they need to know that there is a real problem to solve. Then explain your idea and
                implementation plan, and finally explain the benefits of implementing your plan.
              </p>

              <p>Tomo:</p>
              <p>I see. Problems, Actions, and Results. Got it. But what if I get objections or concerns?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Jerry:</p>
              <p>An objection is an opportunity. It’s their way of telling you what’s important to them.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Tomo:</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Jerry:</p>
              <p>
                Well, I would thank them for bringing it up. And then show that I really understand their concern.
                Then, I can address their concern and have data to back it up.

            <div class="row">
              <p>Jerry:</p>
              <p>
                Here’s what I would say. <u>Thank you</u> for being honest with your concern. I
                <u>totally understand</u> that we have a tight budget especially this time of year. However,
                <u>my idea will actually</u> save the company money over a 3-year span
                <u>as you can see from this chart</u>.

            Think of a work-related problem. Present a possible solution and handle objections or concerns from
            your trainer. Here are some common concerns:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Price: <i>“It’s too expensive.”</i></li>
            <li>Fear of change: <i>“But we’ve done it like this for years.”</i></li>
            <li>Trust: <i>“How can we trust you to do it?”</i></li>
            <li>Timing: <i>“Maybe this isn’t the best time.”</i></li>
            <li>External input: <i>“Maybe we should get input from other managers.”</i></li>
          </ul>
