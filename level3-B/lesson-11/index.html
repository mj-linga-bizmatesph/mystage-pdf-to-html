            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>
              Pretty tough, to be honest. I have so much pressure to make quick decisions, but I need more time
              to think.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              I know how you feel, but time is a luxury. You see, decision-making is about speed. And to make
              good decisions quickly, you need to have a process.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>What do you mean?</p>

            <p>Brad:</p>

              Well, let me show you a simple 4-step process called OODA Loop, developed by Col. John Boyd. This
              will help you react quickly to a situation and come up with a decision.. Here let me show you:
            </p>
          </div>
          <img class="shape" alt="process" src="/images/03-B-process.png" />
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>It looks pretty simple.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              It is but it takes a lot of practice to master each step. It’s about how quickly you are able to
              <u>get all the information you need</u> and <u>accurately analyze</u> this information. Then, you
              can <u>make good decisions</u> and <u>follow through with your actions</u>.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>OK, so I just need to make quick decisions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              No, that’s not it. You need to become faster at collecting the right information and analyzing it.
              Without it, you can’t make a good decision.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>
              I see. So time is important not for decision-making but for collecting and analyzing data for
              decision-making.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              Exactly. But before you begin this process, you need to decide on how to decide and develop an
              open mind.
