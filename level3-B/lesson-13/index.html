            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              OK, let’s imagine that you’ve already decided on the best decision-making approach. Next, you need
              to develop an open mind.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>
              Right. However, I noticed we all sometimes jump to conclusions and deem something as a bad idea.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              Yes, we all have a tendency to think illogically and subjectively. It’s called
              <u>psychological bias</u> and it often leads to poor decisions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>I see. So psychological bias can prevent us from thinking objectively.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>Exactly. One example is making a decision based on information that supports your belief.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>What do you mean?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              Well, let’s say that you’re a firm believer in the power of old-fashioned newspaper marketing and
              you saw an article that 90% of businesses became successful because of it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>
              Oh, I get it. So there’s a tendency that I would decide to stick with this strategy alone because
              the article confirms what I believe in.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              Precisely. Another example is making a huge investment, in spite of the risks involved because
              your past investments were successful.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>Right. I might conclude that the next one would end up successfully as well, right?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              That’s correct. So, it is important to think openly and objectively before using the OODA Loop.
