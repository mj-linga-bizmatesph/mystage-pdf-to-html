            Good decision makers need to be aware of the issues that <span class="red">directly</span> and
            <span class="red">indirectly</span> affect them <span class="red">now</span> and that may affect
            them <span class="red">in the future</span>.

        <div class="conversation">
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>So, the first step in the loop is to observe the situation, right?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>Yes, this is where you gather information to help get a better view of the situation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>
              But I do that. I keep a close eye on all our financial figures and read all the memos from the
              president.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              Knowing what’s happening within your company is important, but you need to be aware of what’s
              happening outside as well.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>Sure, I research our competitors and our industry too.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              That’s excellent. But you can take it even a step further. Good decision makers know what’s
              happening in politics and economics. They’re aware of social trends and new technology. To get
              this information, not only do you need to read a lot but also meet a lot of people.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>That’s a lot of information.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              You’re right. There’s just too much information and most of the time this information is
              incomplete or not completely true.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>So what can I do?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              That’s another skill. Good decision makers look for patterns in the information they get. They see
              how all this information is linked and determine what’s important and what’s not.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>So it’s not just about how much information I get, but how well I can make sense of it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              That’s right, Shinji. Think about how this information directly and indirectly affects you, not
              just now, but in the future.
