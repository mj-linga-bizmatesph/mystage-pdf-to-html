            To act, in the OODA Loop, not only means to <span class="red">implement</span> your decision but
            also to <span class="red">monitor</span> its results.

              The OODA Loop is a <span class="red">continuous learning cycle</span> of observing, orienting,
              deciding, and acting. Don’t stop after implementation.

        <div class="conversation">
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>So, in the previous stage, we finalized our decision.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>I suppose it’s time for me to act on my decision.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>That’s right. So be sure to act on it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>What do you mean by that?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              Well, a lot of people and organizations use the OODA Loop, but some of them fall short because
              they fail to act on their decisions.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>I see. So they just stop at finalizing their decisions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              Yes. You see, the OODA Loop is more of a <u>learning process</u>. Every time we take action, we learn a
              little more of the situation. Without taking action, no new information comes in and the learning
              stops.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>So, I guess taking action is kind of like testing the market.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>
              That’s right. When companies wait too long on taking action, they very quickly fall behind the
              competition. The market leaders are the ones who take action, gather new information, and make
              necessary adjustments based on this new information.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>
              I understand. Then I really need to act on my decision, monitor the results, and collect new
              information.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>Exactly. I think you’re ready to apply the OODA Loop with your team.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
