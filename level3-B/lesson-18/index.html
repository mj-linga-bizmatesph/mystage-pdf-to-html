              Well, my team and I went through the process you taught me and came up with a plan and implemented
              it. But it’s not getting the results we expected.
            </p>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>I see. So, what are you going to do?</p>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>Well, we’re trying to come up with a new idea.</p>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>
            <p>Wait a second. Do you remember I said that the OODA Loop is a continuous learning cycle?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>Oh, right!</p>

            <p>Brad:</p>

              As soon as you implement your decision, you need to immediately
              <u>go back to the “observe” stage</u>. Do you remember what that is?
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>
              Yes, I need to be aware of the issues that affect us directly and indirectly, not just now but
              also in the future.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Brad:</p>

              That’s right. So now you have new information from your actions. So, analyze it and orient
              yourself with reality. It’s OK if your assumptions weren’t accurate the first time as long as you
              continue to observe, orient, decide, and take action again.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Shinji:</p>
            <p>
              I get it now. So I need to keep going through the process as I make adjustments to our plan.
              Thanks.
