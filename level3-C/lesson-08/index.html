                  As for Product A, <u>the year started pretty much the same as last year</u>. 
                  We had our usual contract renewals from major clients.
                  This led to stable figures in Q1&Q2. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Q3, <u>we got that huge contract with MEDTEC</u>, which took us to our peak with nearly 40 million in sales. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, <u>the good news ended there</u>. 
                  As you all know, production problems at the Thai factory prevented us from meeting delivery dates, and we lost a big portion of our business.

            Analyze the charts below. Look for trends and changes in the charts and try to come up with some reasons that might have affected the figures.
