              Ask yourself what your real purpose is for making connections. Without a <span class="red">good reason</span> 
              for making connections, social networking may just be <span class="red">a waste of time</span>.

                Frank, how did you make so many business connections?

              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                Well, I’ve invested a lot of time in social networking. 
              </p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>Purpose? I have no purpose. It’s just business.</p>

              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>Unless you have a clear purpose, trying to make connections may be a 	waste of time. Plus, it’s extremely difficult. By knowing what you want 	to achieve, networking will become much more meaningful. </p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>That makes sense. So, what’s your purpose?</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>Well, we already have a lot of opportunities to meet people in our 	industry. So, my purpose is to meet people outside of this industry.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>I don’t make connections to make a sale. I mean if I get a new client 	from my connections, that’s a bonus but it’s certainly not my motive.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>Well, I think everyone has some unique business experience or expertise that they could share. For example, if I needed a good lawyer or an 	accountant, one of my contacts may be able to recommend one. At the same time, I feel I have something that I can share with others, too. </p>
