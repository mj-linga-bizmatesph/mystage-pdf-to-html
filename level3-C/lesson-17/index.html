              <p>Hi John,</p>
              <p>It was really nice meeting you and Karen at the wine-tasting event yesterday.</p>
              <p>
                Thanks to you, I’ve started to take a keen interest in wine tasting. 
                So, you might see more of me at these events.
                Anyway, I’ll keep an eye out for any interesting business information for you.
              </p>
              <p>Take care and hope to see you again soon.</p>
              <p>Regards,<span>Yasu</span></p>
