              I just happened to come across this article on the emergence of small Japanese manufacturers. 
              It’s a Japanese newspaper, but they had a special English edition this time. 
              Anyway, I’ve attached a scanned copy of the article for you.   
            </p>
            <p>I hope you like it. Talk to you soon.</p>
            <p>Regards,<span>Yasu</span></p>
