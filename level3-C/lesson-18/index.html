                  I just happened to come across this article on the emergence of small Japanese manufacturers. It’s a Japanese newspaper, but they had a special English edition this time. Anyway,
                  I’ve attached a scanned copy of the article for you.
                </p>
                <p>I hope you like it. Talk to you soon.</p>
