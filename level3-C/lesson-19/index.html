            <p class="text">
              Social networking is about
              <span class="red">helping people</span>. Don’t expect something in
              return.

              Social networking is not about how well you can
              <span class="red">talk</span>, it’s more about how well you can
              <span class="red">listen</span>.

              <p>So how was the wine-tasting event?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                Excellent. I met someone there and we’ve been exchanging e-mails
                since then. Your techniques were really useful.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>Really? Like what?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                Well, I started the conversation by commenting on the venue. And
                I asked a lot of open-ended questions to get him to speak more.
                Also, when we started talking about work, I avoided technical
                language and kept it simple.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                So it seems like your views on networking have changed a lot.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                Yes, I’ve realized it’s a lot of work to meet new people, make
                some kind of connection, and then keep in touch.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                Exactly. So, unless you really enjoy doing this, it’s not easy
                to keep up.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                But it was really satisfying being able to offer some help.
                Information that’s meaningless to you could be very valuable to
                others.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Frank:</p>
              <p>
                That’s right. Each of us has his or her own unique experiences
                and expertise to share. By being a good listener, you’ll be able
                to find out your contacts’ needs and suggest an attractive
                solution.
              </p>

              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                So, social networking isn’t just for people who like to talk.
