                Yasu, we have a new employee joining our department next week and I’d like you to be his mentor.

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>OK, but how should I approach this? Should I start with goal setting?</p>

              <p>Rick:</p>
              <p>
                Well, the first thing I suggest you do is build a relationship with him. Once you’ve done that,
                you can start setting goals.

                Well, let me introduce a really effective mentoring model that I learned. The basic concept is
                that a trainee goes through four different stages of development. As the trainee progresses to the
                next stage of development, you as the mentor also need to change your approach.

              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>What are the four approaches?</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Rick:</p>
              <p>The four approaches are directing, coaching, supporting, and delegating.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>So, I should be directive with the new guy at first?</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Rick:</p>
              <p>It depends on his development level. Why don’t you get to know him first?</p>
