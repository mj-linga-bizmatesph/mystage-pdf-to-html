                OK, Willy. Let’s get started. Today, I just want to get your thoughts on what you’d like to
                achieve in the first 3 months, and then we can look at our skills list for your position, and then
                we can set some training goals.
              </p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>That sounds clear to me.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>Great. So, what would you like to achieve in your first 3 months?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>
                I guess I’d like to be able to perform my work without you or Rick having to worry about me by the
                end of the 3-month period.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>So, you’d like to be able to work confidently without supervision?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>Yes, and hopefully add value to the team.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                That’s really good. Let’s look at some specific areas now. Here’s the skills list for your
                position. I know it’s a long list, but what areas do you feel you need the most support in?

            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>Well, I have some experience here, but not in these areas here.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>OK, let’s talk about what you could do to improve in these areas.</p>
