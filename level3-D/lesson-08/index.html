                OK, it’s been a month since you started writing reports, which
                is the deadline we had set for you to learn this skill. <br />
                I think you are OK with this. Let’s go to the next skill.

                Oh, I don’t know. I thought you were going to test me on it or
                something.
              </p>

                OK, it’s been a month since you started writing reports, which
                is the deadline we had set for you to learn this skill. How
                comfortable are you now with the report system?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>I’m really comfortable.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>Why do you say that?</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>
                I feel that I not only know how to make reports, but I also know
                how to solve any issues that come up with the reports. In fact,
                some people now come to me when they have a problem with the
                report system.

                I agree. I think you’ve become our report writing expert. So,
                what worked well and what was difficult for you in learning this
                task?
              </p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>
                Well, it was a lot more technical than I had initially expected.
                There were so many steps and I had a hard time memorizing them
                all. However, after I started to learn why each step was
                important, the entire flow became clear and much easier to
                memorize.
