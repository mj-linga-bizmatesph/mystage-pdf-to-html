              There’s <span class="red">no one way</span> in mentoring. However, knowing a mentoring model helps
              to act as a guide.

                It’s important to understand which <span class="red">approach</span> to take depending on the
                <span class="red">trainee’s level</span> of commitment and skill.

              <p>Willy, now that you are a report writing expert, I’d like you to help Cindy with the reports.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>Me? But I’m still new.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                Yes, you’re still new and there are things you need to learn, but you’re our expert on the
                reports. You see, Cindy’s actually never received any training on how to use the report system.
                So, I’d like you to go over it with her.

              <p>Willy:</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>Do you remember what I did with you?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>Yeah, we set goals together.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                Before that, I spent a bit of time to get to know you. That was a very important step, wasn’t it?
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>
                Yeah, I remember. And then, we set specific goals. And you gave me really specific instructions at
                first.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>That’s right. And when you lost confidence, I was a lot more supportive, wasn’t I?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>Yes, you were. And then, you moved to a more participative approach.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                That’s right. Basically, I went from directing to coaching to supporting and finally to
                delegating.

              <p>It all makes sense now. OK, I’ll get to know Cindy first.</p>
