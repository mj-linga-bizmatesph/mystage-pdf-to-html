            Assertive communication is not just about getting what you want. It’s a style of communicating your
            needs in an <span class="red">open</span> and <span class="red">honest</span> way while
            <span class="red">respecting others</span>.

              Assertive communication is not a style that you use all the time with everyone. Be
              <span class="red">selective</span> when you use assertiveness.

              Yasu, now that you have some mentoring experience, I’d like you to work on becoming a little more
              assertive.

              No, aggressive and assertive are very different. Someone who is assertive knows what he wants, is
              willing to ask for it, but respects the rights of others.

            <p>
              But assertiveness is not a common trait among Japanese. The Japanese tend to be indirect and
              respect other people’s opinions.

              I understand. However, being assertive means being direct while being respectful. And to be an
              effective communicator in global business, you need to be assertive sometimes.

              It’s true; some tend to be naturally more assertive than others. However, assertive communication
              is a skill which can be learned.
