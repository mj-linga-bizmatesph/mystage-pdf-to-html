              Frank, you might think this is silly, but I thought maybe it would be good for our team to hold a
              welcome party for Willy.

              Frank, it’s been a month since Willy joined our team. I suggest that we hold a welcome party for
              Willy.

              It’s not a matter of necessity. It’s just that he still hasn’t worked with some of the people from
              our team. So, a welcome party would give him a chance to get to know everyone better.

              In that case, I’d be happy to coordinate it. I’ll send out an e-mail with a choice of dates and
              venues. And of course, it’ll only be for the people who can attend.
