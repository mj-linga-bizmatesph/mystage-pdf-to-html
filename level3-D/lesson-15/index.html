            To be assertive, you can give a “<span class="red">Yes</span>” answer, a “<span class="red">No</span
            >” answer, or request for <span class="red">some time to decide</span>.

              Assertive communication isn’t just saying “Yes” or “No”. In order to answer with a “Yes” or “No”,
              you need to have <span class="red">good reason</span>.
