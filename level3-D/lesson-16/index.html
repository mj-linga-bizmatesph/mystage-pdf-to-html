              Going head-to-head in an argument where the other person is attacking you is

                One common technique in assertive communication is to
                <span class="red">partially agree</span> with someone who is attacking you
                <span class="red">without apologizing</span> unless you feel that you are at fault.

                I’m sure there are many great restaurants out there, but out of the three choices we had, I still
                think this was the best choice.

                Well, I agree the food could be better, but the purpose of this party is to welcome Willy, and he
                seems to be having a good time. So, in that sense, I’m glad we had this party.
