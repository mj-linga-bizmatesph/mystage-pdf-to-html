                I know you were disappointed with my choice of the restaurant for Willy’s welcome party, but I
                feel that our working relationship has suffered since then. I’d like us to be able to work
                together like we did before.

                I know you really wanted to go to that Indian restaurant. It was my responsibility to make a
                choice. And I felt that this was the best choice this time. Anyway, let’s go to that Indian
                restaurant for lunch.
