              As much as we hate to do it, sometimes it’s necessary to say “<span class="red">no</span>” to
              requests.

                When saying “no”, there are some useful techniques you can use, such as
                <span class="red">buying time</span>, <span class="red">explaining your priorities</span>, and
                <span class="red">repeating your answer</span>.

                Basically, I need someone to do some research on a new Chinese competitor that’s entered our
                market. With your connections in the Chinese office, I thought you’d be the best person to do
                this.

                Sure you are. And if you have trouble, I’ll give you the support you need. Could you get started
                on it right away?
