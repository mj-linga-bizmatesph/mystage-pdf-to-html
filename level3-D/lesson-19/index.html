            <p>Yasu, I heard that you turned down Frank’s request to take on that new project.</p>

            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              Yeah, I had no choice. My priority was to make sure that the TNS contract was successful. If I had
              accepted that project, I would have run the risk of missing key deadlines.
            </p>

          <div class="row">
            <p>Willy:</p>
            <p>I wish I could be more assertive like you.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              Well, you can. Assertive communication is a skill that you need to learn and practice, just like
              any other communication skill.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Willy:</p>
            <p>
              If I could be more assertive, I would be able to say “no” to projects and have less work to do.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              Assertive communication isn’t about saying “no” to projects and doing less work. It’s a skill that
              allows you to effectively communicate both positive and negative feelings in an open way while
              maintaining respect for the other person.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Willy:</p>
            <p>But I sometimes lack the confidence to do that with some people.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              That’s completely natural. And I certainly wouldn’t be assertive with everyone about everything.
              You have to be careful how you use this skill.
            </p>

            <p>Well, can you give some basic tips on how to be more assertive?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">

            <p>Sure, let’s start with some basic points.</p>
