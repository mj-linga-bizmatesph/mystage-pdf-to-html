          <div class="row">

            <p>Rick:</p>
            <p>
              Yasu, persuasive communication isn’t measured by the amount of confidence or charisma one has.
              It’s measured by the responses you get from people. You convinced me with your proposal because
              you did your research, you explained it clearly and logically, and you communicated it
              persuasively.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>But I know you. So, it was easy.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Rick:</p>
            <p>
              That’s true. Persuading people you don’t know very well is much more challenging, but the basic
              approach is the same.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>What’s the approach?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Rick:</p>
            <p>
              First, you need to know what the executives want. They also need to know who you are and why they
              should listen to you.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>What about all the techniques you use?</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Rick:</p>
            <p>
              We’ll talk about that too, but don’t expect revolutionary tricks that work like magic because
              that’s not persuasive communication. It’s really about understanding your listeners’ needs,
              framing your proposal to meet their needs, supporting your idea with data, and connecting with
              them.
