              <p>Rick:</p>
              <p>Yes. So place yourself in their shoes. What are they most interested in?</p>

              <p>Rick:</p>
              <p>
                Of course, but let’s look a little more carefully at some of the factors that the executives are
                concerned about.

              <p>
                Well, our profitability has gone down due to price cuts brought on by foreign competition. We’ve
                lost 3% of our market share over the last four years. And we haven’t released any new products for
                the last two years.

              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                I’m going to tell them that I have an idea for a revolutionary business model that will allow us
                to increase our profitability, gain market share, and offer a unique product nonexistent in the
                market.
