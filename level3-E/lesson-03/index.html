                First, I’d like to thank the executive directors for this opportunity to present my idea. My name
                is Yasu Takeda and I work in the overseas sales department. I’d like to present a new business

                  Before I begin, please allow me to briefly introduce myself. My name is Yasu Takeda and I work

                <p>
                  Before joining MMB, I worked for MEDTEC, one of our biggest clients, where I was able to see
                  firsthand the range of products offered by our competitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What I saw were different sales approaches by different wiring companies for the same product.
                  Some were packaged differently and had nicer brochures, but essentially, these companies were
                  selling the same thing. And most of the time, price was the determining factor for our decision.

              Do you think the executive directors would be more interested in listening to the rest of Yasu’s
