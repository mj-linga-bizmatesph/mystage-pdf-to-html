                  <span>So what are the major issues that we are facing at MMB Corp?</span>
                  <span>
                    Certainly it’s no secret that over the last three years, our <u>profitability</u> has gone down more than 5%, our <u>market share</u> down by 3%, and not a single
                    <u>product release</u>.
                  </span>
                  <span>
                    This is not unique to MMB Corp. but a trend seen in many domestic companies in our industry. In my proposal, I would like to introduce a new business model that will bring our
                    <u>profitability</u> back to our peak years, enter a new <u>untapped market</u>, and allow us to <u>release several new products</u> each year.
