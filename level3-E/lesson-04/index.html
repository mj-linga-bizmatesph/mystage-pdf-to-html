              <p>So what are the major issues that we are facing at MMB Corp?</p>
              <p>
                Certainly it’s no secret that over the last three years, our <u>profitability</u> has gone down
                more than 5%, our <u>market share</u> down by 3%, and not a single <u>product release</u>.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is not unique to MMB Corp. but a trend seen in many domestic companies in our industry. In
                my proposal, I would like to introduce a new business model that will bring our
                <u>profitability</u> back to our peak years, enter a new <u>untapped market</u>, and allow us to
                <u>release several new products</u> each year.
