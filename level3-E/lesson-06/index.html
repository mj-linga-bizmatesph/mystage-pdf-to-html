                Customization is a trend that we see everywhere in the consumer business. As our clients offer
                more flexibility in their products, they need their suppliers to do the same.
              </p>
              <p>
                We already receive many requests for customized products from our clients. And each year, that
                figure is growing. However, our production team cannot handle this new demand.

                Customization is a trend that we see everywhere in the consumer business.
                <u>For example: customized travel plans, customized car interiors, customized internet services, etc</u>.

              <p>
                <u>Here, I have a chart that shows</u> the number of requests for customized products from our
                top three clients over the last three years. We received 300 requests in 2010, 450 requests in
                2011, and over 850 in 2012.
              </p>
              <p>
                What do these figures tell us? <u>They show that</u> customization is growing and it’s growing
                fast.
