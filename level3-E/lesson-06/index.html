                    Customization is a trend that we see everywhere in the consumer business.
                    <u>For example: customized travel plans, customized car interiors, customized internet services, etc</u>.

                  <span>
                    <u>Here, I have a chart that shows</u> the number of requests for customized products from our top three clients over the last three years. We received 300 requests in 2010, 450
                    requests in 2011, and over 850 in 2012.
                  </span>
                  <span>What do these figures tell us? <u>They show that</u> customization is growing and it’s growing fast.</span>
