                  <span>My proposal for a systematic customization model is based on a simple fact: it makes business sense.</span>
                  <span>
                    It makes business sense <u>because</u> it’ll increase our profitability. It’ll increase our profitability <u>because</u> our clients would be willing to pay more. They would be
                    willing to pay more <u>because</u> they can offer customized products at a premium price to end-users.

                    <u>If</u> we implement this system by October of this year, we would be able to make it in time for the winter bonus season. <br />
                    <u>If</u> we make it in time for the bonus season, we could make special offers to our clients.<br />
                    <u>If</u> we do that, we would gain market share.
