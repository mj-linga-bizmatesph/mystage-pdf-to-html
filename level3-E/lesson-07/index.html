            One simple way to help form your logic is to ask yourself “<span class="red">Why</span>” a few
            times.

                My proposal for a systematic customization model is based on a simple fact: it makes business
                sense.
              </p>
              <p>
                It makes business sense <u>because</u> it’ll increase our profitability. It’ll increase our
                profitability <u>because</u> our clients would be willing to pay more. They would be willing to
                pay more <u>because</u> they can offer customized products at a premium price to end-users.
              </p>
              <p>
                <u>If</u> we implement this system by October of this year, we would be able to make it in time
                for the winter bonus season. <br />
                <u>If</u> we make it in time for the bonus season, we could make special offers to our
                clients.<br />
                <u>If</u> we do that, we would gain market share.
