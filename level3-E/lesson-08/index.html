                While I was coming up with this idea, I had a chance to share my thoughts with my colleagues,
                some managers, and a few directors. The response was very positive.
                <u>The excitement and energy I felt from them really motivated me to make this proposal</u>.

                I’m sure that there are other factors that need to be considered at the executive level that I’m
                not aware of. <u>However, I do know that many people at MMB are ready to take action</u>.
