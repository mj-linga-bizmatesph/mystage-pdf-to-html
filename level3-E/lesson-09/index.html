              Persuasive communication is not something you do in a single presentation. It’s a
              <span class="red">long-term process</span>.

                Persuasive communication is knowing your audience’s needs, framing your ideas to meet their needs,
                supporting with evidence, and connecting with your listeners.

              <p>Yasu, I heard that the executives were really impressed with your proposal. Well done.</p>

              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>Well, I got a lot of help from Rick. He helped me learn the art of persuasive communication.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>Yeah, I’d like to learn how to wow an audience in a presentation, too..</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                One thing that I learned about persuasive communication is that it’s not something you do to wow
                an audience in a one-time presentation.

                It’s an entire process that requires time and commitment. It’s about making the effort to really
                know your listeners, framing your ideas to meet their needs, supporting your ideas with facts,
                evidence, and examples, and most importantly connecting with them.
