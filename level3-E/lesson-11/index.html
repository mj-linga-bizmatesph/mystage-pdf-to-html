              Thanks Rick. It’s my first time to take on a managerial role. So, I’m a little worried about it.

              It’s certainly not an easy transition from worker to manager. Suddenly, you deal with pressure
              from people above you and below.

              I don’t know if I can handle all this pressure. I’m not really the type of person to lead people.

          <div class="row">
            <p>Rick:</p>
            <p>You’re right. He also takes quick action and communicates well.</p>

              Thanks for this talk, Rick. I feel much more motivated. I’m going to make some major changes. I
              don’t want to be a boring manager; I want to be a great leader.

              Hold on a second, Yasu. Don’t forget that you are a manager, and your job is to manage the
              operation of your team. With leadership skills, you can instill motivation and change, but your
              job is to manage the daily operation. That’s important, too.
