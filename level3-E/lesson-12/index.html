                  Hi, everyone. The reason I called this meeting is because I am your new boss, and I would like to explain my vision. This is important because it is what I expect from you. Our
                  company target for this year is to increase sales by 8%. However, I want all of you to aim for 10%. I want to be able to say that my team achieved the highest sales figures in our
                  company.
                </p>

                    Hi, everyone. I’ve already had individual meetings with all of you wherein I got some great ideas on how to make our team better. I’ve gone ahead and molded these ideas to make a
                    draft vision for our team. So, I’d like to share this and get your feedback. Here it goes: <br />
                    “To create a tight-knit team that willingly shares information and willingly offers support to our members so that we can all surpass our targets and be recognized and rewarded for
                    our performance.” So, what this means is I want all of us to be known as the best, not individually, but as a team. If we can do that, then I know that all of us will be rewarded
                    and recognized not only for being high achievers but also team players. This is just a draft I put together based on your ideas, but what do you think?
