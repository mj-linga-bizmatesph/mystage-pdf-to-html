              Well, I need to know what you want to purchase, why you want to purchase it, and how much it’s
              going to cost.

              I’ve set aside a budget for miscellaneous purchases. Are you planning on purchasing something?

          <div class="row">
            <p>Lin:</p>
            <p>
              I was thinking of getting a whiteboard to be used as a message board to improve communication
              within our team.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              That’s an excellent idea. That’s in line with our vision to willingly share information. Good job.
            </p>

            <p>Lin:</p>

            <p>Yasu:</p>
            <p>
              But before you make the purchase, could you share this idea with the team to get their input? And
              once you’ve decided what to purchase, could you do a simple price analysis first? Let’s try to
              find the best deal so that we can use the budget for other ideas, too.
