                Oh, yes. One of the senior managers asked me about our new message board. He is thinking of doing
                something similar in his department.

                No, that’s not necessary. I’ll do that. Could you just make a simple report on how it’s used, the
                merits of the system, and how much it costs?

                Don’t worry, it’s good news. One of the senior managers asked me about your new message board. He
                is thinking of doing something similar in his department.

              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>Yes, I do. It was your idea. You know the system better than anyone.</p>

            <div class="row">
