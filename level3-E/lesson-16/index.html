              Blaming others is a <span class="red">defense mechanism</span> that leaders do not use. True leaders
              take responsibility for their team.

                Yasu, I heard a rumor that someone from your team charged an outrageous price for our products.

                Not a good idea? He put the company at risk. If the client were to find out, this could lead to a
                major complaint. This client would never do business with us again. Our brand image would be
                damaged.

              <p>I know. Jack only thinks about his sales targets. He really needs some training in ethics.</p>

                Yes, that’s right. The employee spoke to me about it, and I had him immediately revise the
                proposal for the client. We apologized to the client saying that it was a mistake.

                It was Jack, but please understand that I take full responsibility for this. Our team vision
                wasn’t clearly communicated and Jack thought he was doing the right thing for the team. I have
                spoken to him about this, and he clearly understands that it was wrong and he will never do that
                again.
