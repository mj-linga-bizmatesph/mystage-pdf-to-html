              It’s going great. Here’s some key information that we’ve gathered over the past two weeks. One
              interesting news is the merger between AutoTech and SPT Company. They may be looking to change
              suppliers in the near future. You can review the rest in your own time.

              OK, everyone. I want you to think about what you can do as individuals to improve sales. Then,
