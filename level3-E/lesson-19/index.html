              Your leadership skills are measured by the number of <span class="red">followers</span> you have,
              not by the number of <span class="red">staff</span> reporting to you.

                Leadership is a skill that is not only reserved for managers. It’s essential for people in
                <span class="red">all levels</span> of an organization.

                Thanks Willy, but it wasn’t me. It was due to the hard work and collaboration of my team. I was
                really lucky to have such dedicated people.

                Well, I’m not an expert yet. But you can become a great leader. Leadership is a skill that you
                need to learn and practice, just like any other communication skill.
              </p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>Yeah, but I’m not charismatic like you.</p>

            <div class="row">
              <p>Yasu:</p>
              <p>
                I used to think that leadership is about charisma and confidence. But I’ve realized there’s a lot
                more to it than that. It’s about integrity, taking responsibility, showing dedication to your
                vision, and many more qualities.

            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <p>Willy:</p>
              <p>
                Well, I’m not going to be a manager for at least a few years, so I guess I won’t have to worry
                about that.

                The most important thing that I’ve learned is that leadership isn’t just for managers. It’s
                something that every employee should have.
