              Sociological research has shown that it is human nature to group people and experiences into easily understandable categories. The habit of stereotyping is so
              <span class="highlight">prevalent</span> that we don’t even realize we subconsciously form generalized opinions about a group of people based on a single interaction with an individual.
              In general, stereotyping helps the human brain cope with our increasingly complex world.

            <div class="article">
              However, it also makes us prone to racial stereotyping. Racial stereotyping focuses on cultural differences instead of similarities and ignores individual personalities and unique
              competencies. It makes us see our differences as problems, and creates an <span class="highlight">"us versus them" mentality</span> — which could result in misunderstandings, damaged
              relationships, and conflicts.

              By being aware of the dangers of racial stereotyping, its causes, and the damage it could inflict, we can learn to <span class="highlight">tackle the issue</span> with a more balanced
              view, focus on our similarities rather than our differences, and work toward mutually beneficial goals.
