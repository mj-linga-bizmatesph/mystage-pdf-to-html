              We all live in a world bound by rules and regulations. Some <span class="highlight">follow these rules to the letter</span> whereas others bend or even break the rules depending on
              certain circumstances. This first dimension of culture, universalism versus particularism, defines how much flexibility a particular culture allows.

            <div class="article">
              <span class="b u">Universalism: <br /></span>
              People from universalist cultures believe that rules need to be followed regardless of the situation. If the rules are broken, one must face the consequences — no exceptions. For
              example, in Germany, anyone trying to cross the street when the light is red, even if there are no cars, would be <span class="highlight">looked down upon</span>.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              <span class="b u">Particularism: <br /></span>
              People from particularist cultures believe that rules are general guidelines. Relationships and circumstances, more than laws and regulations, often
              <span class="highlight">dictate</span> one’s behaviour. For example, in Russia, it would not be uncommon for a person to lie to the police to keep a friend from being arrested.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              If people from these two cultures <span class="highlight">impose</span> their values onto others without thought or consideration, problems are bound to occur. Preventing conflict is
              key, and Stephen R. Covey’s “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,” prescribes the first step: in order to be understood, one must first seek to understand.
