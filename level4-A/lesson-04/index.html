            All human beings have their own <span class="highlight">inclinations</span> and interests. However, depending on one’s upbringing
            and education, personal and self-focused interests may either be encouraged or discouraged in favor
            of the larger interests of one’s community. Our second dimension of culture explores this in more
            detail.

            <span class="b u">Individualism: <br></span>
            In an individualistic culture, people are free to pursue their own interests, make their own decisions,
            and are recognized independently for personal achievements. The “American Dream” is the <span class="highlight">epitome</span>
            of individualism, where people believe that hard work and freedom lead to success.

          <div class="article">
            <span class="b u">Communitarianism: <br></span>
            In a communitarian culture, the group comes first. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the
            few, and sacrifices are expected to be made in exchange for protection, acceptance, and group
            <span class="highlight">prosperity</span>. In Japan, the concept of lifetime employment is a prime example of communitarian
            values.

          <div class="article">
            Though conflict between these two cultures seems unavoidable, establishing guidelines and
            objectives that both parties can refer to may be a good first step in building a strong, dependable
            relationship. After all, communication and understanding are the <span class="highlight">bedrock</span> of any successful
            partnership.
