            How openly one expresses their emotions <span class="highlight">bespeaks</span> their culture and background. Though some may
            have been brought up to share their thoughts and emotions freely, others may behave differently.
            Our third dimension of culture compares and contrasts these two ways of handling emotions

          <div class="article">
            <span class="b u">Neutral: <br></span>
            In neutral cultures, self-control and the inhibition of emotions is thought to be considerate and
            professional. For example, New Zealanders <span class="highlight">tend to</span> communicate in soft tones with minimal gestures
            and often joke about their neighboring Australians’ overly-friendly nature.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <span class="b u">Affective: <br></span>
            People from affective cultures have been encouraged from an early age to express what is on their
            minds using gestures, tonal shifts, and facial reactions. For example, in Spain, people are considered
            very <span class="highlight">touchy-feely</span> and will often kiss, hug, and may even interrupt someone speaking as a sign of
            interest.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            We all experience emotions, yet one’s perception and expression of these feelings may result in
            misunderstandings. By <span class="highlight">refraining</span> from making judgements based on our counterpart’s expression of
            emotions or lack thereof, we can ensure that our relationships remain healthy and productive.
