            How do you view your boss outside of the office? Is he or she just another regular person that you
            happen to work with? Or do you show the same level of respect and <span class="highlight">deference</span> as you would at work?
            Some do, some don’t. Let’s explore this more in the fourth dimension of culture: specific and diffuse. 
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <span class="b u">Specific: <br></span>
            Specific-oriented cultures separate their professional and personal lives and believe that relationships
            <span class="highlight">have little bearing on</span> achieving objectives. For instance, in the U.S., friendly relationships are
            quickly created, only for the relationship to abruptly end once the goal has been achieved.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <span class="b u">Diffuse: <br></span>
            On the other hand, diffuse-oriented cultures treat relationships as <span class="highlight">all-encompassing</span>. For them,
            business is personal and one’s professional relationship with others extends well into their private
            lives. For example, in Japan, much time and patience may be required for relationships to form;
            however, it is not uncommon for business partners to become lifelong friends.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            Some may view specific-oriented people as <span class="highlight">frivolous</span> time wasters, or diffuse-oriented people as cold
            and difficult to read. However, it’s important to note that business success also depends on
            relationships, among other factors. Taking the time to recognize each other’s priorities can help both
            parties strike a balance that they can benefit from.
