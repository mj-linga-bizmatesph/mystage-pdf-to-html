            Status and success are common motivators that appear in many societies across the globe. However,
            where this status originates from differs from culture to culture. In our fifth dimension of culture, we
            will explore how status is achieved or <span class="highlight">ascribed</span> across cultures.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <span class="b u">Achievement: <br></span>
            In an achievement-oriented culture, one attains status through what they have accomplished.
            Therefore, one’s track record, awards, and unique achievements are highly valued. For example, in
            Norway, it isn’t uncommon to see bright, talented youngsters <span class="highlight">climb the ranks</span>
            and surpass his or her
            elders.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <span class="b u">Ascription: <br></span>
            In an ascription-oriented culture, one’s status is determined by who they are. This includes things like
            age, gender, family, university, or social connections — to name a few. For example, in the Middle
            East and North Africa, one’s suitability for any particular job may be determined by the candidate’s
            <span class="highlight">alma mater</span>.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            These two cultures may not <span class="highlight">see eye to eye</span> on how status is determined, but
            their distinction reveals
            a common drive for excellence. Understanding differences sometimes leads one to discover important
            similar values between seemingly opposing cultures, allowing both parties to work towards mutual
            success.
