            Although time is a valuable <span class="highlight">commodity</span> shared by all cultures and societies,
            different cultures have
            come to think of time as either a rigid construct, or something with varying degrees of flexibility. The
            sixth dimension of culture takes a deeper look at two distinct perspectives on time.

          <div class="article">
            <span class="b u">Sequential Time: <br></span>
            For sequential-time cultures, <span class="highlight">time is money</span>. Tightly organized schedules are
            expected to be followed
            in order to maximize efficiency. In addition, more focus is given to short-term goals. For example,
            meetings in the U.K. are well-structured with a clear purpose and a strict agenda.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <span class="b u">Synchronous Time: <br></span>
            In synchronous-time cultures, people behave more flexibly when it comes to time. Although goals are
            clearly established, scheduling is far looser, allowing for people to work on multiple projects. As a
            result, countries like Mexico <span class="highlight">place greater emphasis on</span> long-term planning
            than on short-term goals.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            Although logic may tell us that sequential-time cultures would be more productive, recent studies
            have shown that a synchronous approach has proven to be more effective for complex projects.
            Therefore, <span class="highlight">striking a balance</span> between the two may be the best route to
            securing success.
