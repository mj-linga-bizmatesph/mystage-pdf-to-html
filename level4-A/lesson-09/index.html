          <div class="article">
            Since the dawn of man, we have asked ourselves: are we <span class="highlight">at the mercy of</span> nature
            or are we the
            masters of our own fates? This question that has shaped many cultures and defined millions of people
            is central to the final dimension of culture: inner direction versus outer direction.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <span class="b u">Inner Direction: <br></span>
            People in inner-directed cultures seek to control their environment and believe that everyone is
            accountable for their own situations regardless of external factors. For example, Western companies
            invest <span class="highlight">exorbitant</span> amounts of money to understand and control the laws of
            nature, creating numerous
            inventions and patents.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <span class="b u">Outer Direction: <br></span>
            People in outer-directed cultures believe that there is no controlling nature and fate. Only by
            adapting one’s approach to fit the environment and by working together can we find peace and
            prosperity. For example, Eastern countries are more <span class="highlight">adept at</span> taking existing
            technology to create
            more refined and popular products.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            Recognizing what we can and cannot control enables us to more effectively position ourselves in a
            manner that allows us to find success. Sometimes, we need to learn how to <span class="highlight">roll with
              the punches</span> —
            regardless of whether we find ourselves in a fateful position or a man-made predicament.
