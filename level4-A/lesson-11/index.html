              Yuji, a senior director, has recently been transferred to the Philippines to manage an overseas subsidiary. Although things went smoothly at first, Yuji’s relationship with the local
              manager, Rupert, began to sour after <span class="highlight">bouts</span> of miscommunication and cultural misunderstandings.

                <p>
                  I can’t believe Yuji yelled at me in front of the others. So what if Mia missed her monthly target? What’s that got to do with me? I’m not a slave to be yelled at. I come from an
                  important family, got my MBA in the US, and <span class="highlight">cut my teeth</span> for years at this company. To be honest, I’m not sure what Yuji wants. He needs to really
                  rethink his approach.

                  Rupert needs to take more responsibility for his team. We need to think long-term and start focusing on more than just meeting our monthly targets. Winning the battle doesn’t mean
                  winning the war. Rupert, and everyone around him, needs to be reminded of this. We’re all in this together, so there’s no point in
                  <span class="highlight">beating around the bush</span>.

              Although Rupert was enjoying his work, he is now thinking of leaving the company and taking a
              <span class="highlight">lucrative</span> package from a competing firm where he feels he will get the respect he deserves. Yuji was confused as to why things were so difficult with
              Rupert; and why, despite his best efforts, they were unable to make progress.
