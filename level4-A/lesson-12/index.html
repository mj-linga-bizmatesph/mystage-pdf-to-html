              Greg, the chief negotiator for an American IT company, has been working hard to set up a joint venture with Haruko, the
              <span class="highlight">liaison</span> and translator for a large manufacturing company. After weeks of hard work, they meet with Haruko’s board of directors to present their work.
              Sadly, things didn’t go as planned.

                  What?! They’re thinking about pulling out?! I thought the deal was <span class="highlight">in the bag</span>! When I presented the details of the contract, everyone seemed like they
                  were on board. We’ve been at this for months now. If we don’t set firm deadlines, a few more months could pass before anything happens! This is business and time is money. What
                  happened?

                  Yes, even though you presented everything we discussed, the board felt that such a long contract was a sign of how little your company actually trusts us. Plus, giving them a
                  deadline
                  <span class="highlight">added insult to injury</span>. We Japanese are not accustomed to this style of business. In Japan, it takes much more than a detailed contract and a
                  handshake...

              Greg’s approach, though well-intended, has jeopardized Wire’s joint venture with Ito Manufacturing. Haruko is attempting to calm the executives, but the board is seriously considering
              withdrawing from the deal. Greg must now urgently make
              <span class="highlight">reparations</span>, for the success of the partnership hangs by a thread.
