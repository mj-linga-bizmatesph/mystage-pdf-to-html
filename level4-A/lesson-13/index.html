            Klaus Weber, a German national, arrived in Tokyo <span class="highlight">to head</span> his firm’s Sales Department. Although
            everyone in the team is anxious, Takumi Sato, a junior employee, can’t wait for the chance to speak
            English again after leaving his American university. Klaus, however, didn’t share Takumi’s enthusiasm.

              <p>
                I studied abroad in the US, so I feel I’m familiar with foreign cultures. However, when I
                greeted Klaus, he seemed sarcastic and unimpressed. To break the ice, I asked him about
                his family and life at home, but he basically <span class="highlight">brushed me off</span> and asked about my targets
                this year. When I presented my three-year vision, he simply said it was illogical. I’m at a
                loss. 
              </p>

            <div class="col">
              <p>
                I understand that Takumi is trying to be open and welcome, but I’m just not comfortable
                talking so openly about my private life. This is something that I feel doesn’t belong in the
                workplace. We’re professionals. <span class="highlight">On that note</span>, I’m not sure where Takumi has been
                focusing his energy. Three-year plans just don’t make sense when our yearly target is
                behind.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            Although Takumi’s experience and approach may have worked with other cultures, Klaus’ own unique
            cultural sensibilities have made him difficult to approach and connect with. In global business and
            cultural etiquette, <span class="highlight">one size certainly doesn’t fit all</span>.
