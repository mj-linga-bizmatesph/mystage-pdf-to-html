            Ken Tamai, the young but talented new general manager of his firm’s sales office in Shanghai, is
            eager to prove himself at his new post. Ken was selected for the position due to his TOEIC score and
            past achievements; however, his inexperience and approach <span class="highlight">started him off on the wrong foot</span> with
            his local staff.

                Yes, I may be young, but I studied at the best university in Japan and have an excellent
                track record. My job is to ensure things run smoothly, like they do at HQ in Tokyo. This
                means rearranging the desks to facilitate better communication with my subordinates
                and being frank when need be. They’re not very cooperative but they’ll soon <span class="highlight">fall in line</span>.

                Ken is ambitious, but he is also very young. That being said, some of our older employees
                are uncomfortable with his management style, especially being <span class="highlight">reprimanded</span> in front of
                others. His process is slowing things down and it’s just not suitable for our working style.
                Those of us who prefer to do things our way are already starting to ignore him.

            With such a large gap in cultural practice and understanding, Ken has a tough challenge ahead of him.
            Ken’s success in his native country may not speak for itself in his new role; bridging cultural
            communication and work-style gaps requires more than just a strong <span class="highlight">pedigree</span> — it requires
            adaptability.
