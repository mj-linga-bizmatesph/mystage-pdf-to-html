            Yoshi Mori, a senior manager, is having a teleconference with Luiz Mendez, his chief counterpart from
            a medium-sized Brazilian plastics manufacturer. Although Yoshi prepared a detailed agenda and
            wanted to <span class="highlight">stick to</span> a strict timeline, Luiz’s team remained uncooperative despite Yoshi’s best efforts.            
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
              <p class="b name">Luiz</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col">
              <p>
                My team and I find Yoshi and his team very difficult to read, no matter how hard we try
                to get them to <span class="highlight">loosen up</span>. We find it hard to do business with those whom we can’t
                connect with on a more personal level. We are passionate people and don’t care much
                for strict formality. We want to know whom we’re doing business with.

              <p>
                From our perspective, Luiz’s team isn’t very professional. They are always late, <span class="highlight">going off
                on tangents</span>, wasting time chit-chatting, and seem unwilling to talk about important
                business matters. I need to report to my executives and meet my deadlines. If things stay
                as they are, I don’t think it’ll work. I might have to be more direct with them.

            “It’s not personal, it’s business,” is a well-known expression that emphasizes the <span class="highlight">impersonal</span> nature
            of business dealings. Yet, for many like Luiz, the opposite is true. Business can be very personal, and
            by understanding each culture’s approach, achieving success may not be as challenging as initially
            believed to be.
