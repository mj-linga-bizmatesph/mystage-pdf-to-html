              Sarah Evans, a management trainee from the UK, is at Tokyo
              headquarters on a two-year training program. Ambitious,
              <span class="highlight">meticulous</span>, and organized, Sarah
              set three-month targets for her two-year stay. Yet, after five
              months of training, her expectations and the reality of the
              situation couldn’t be further apart.

                  It’s been 5 months, and I haven’t learned or done anything
                  new. I came here wanting to spend time in each of the main
                  departments, so why am I still stuck here? My colleagues are
                  nice and often invite me out for drinks after work, but I’m
                  usually not <span class="highlight">in the mood</span>. After
                  a full day at work, I just want to go home. I’m here to learn
                  new skills, not drink.

                  As the manager of the department, I wish Sarah would be more
                  involved. Yes, she is very
                  <span class="highlight">capable</span>, but I’ve received
                  complaints that she isn’t easy to communicate with and often
                  refuses invitations from her fellow colleagues. She wants to
                  learn many things but should focus on building closer
                  relationships to better understand our processes and values.

              Sarah failed to realize that single-mindedly pursuing her ambition
              came <span class="highlight">at the expense of</span> learning
              valuable cultural experience. Before she knew it, she only ended
              up confused and demotivated. However, it is not too late for her
              to achieve her objectives if she aligns her goals with her peers
              to gain mutual understanding and support.
