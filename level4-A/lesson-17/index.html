              Hiro Abe is visiting a Vietnamese supplier to discuss a potential partnership. The manager, Bao Tran, and his assistant, meet with Hiro to discuss the details. After a brief greeting,
              Hiro
              <span class="highlight">probes</span> Bao about quality standards and assurance with little success. Bao then leaves the meeting visibly angry.

                  My company has very tight deadlines and I need to make the most of my time. We take quality control very seriously, and my boss is expecting a complete risk assessment within the
                  next couple of weeks. I had hoped that Bao would
                  <span class="highlight">be on the same page</span>, but he was quite uncooperative; I’m not so sure how to proceed. Don’t we both want this to work?

                  Hiro’s behavior was incredibly insulting. Not only did he embarrass me in front of my assistant by questioning our factory’s quality, he didn’t even bother taking the time to
                  properly introduce himself. Is this how people do business nowadays? In my day, we took the time to establish
                  <span class="highlight">rapport</span> and show respect — not question each other like criminals first chance we get.

              Notwithstanding Hiro and Bao’s mutual desire to successfully establish a partnership, their different cultural backgrounds made their actions seem insensitive or rude to the other. In
              the global stage, what seems like obvious dos and don&#039;ts from our own cultures may not be the same for our partners; successful global partnerships often require one to take a step
              back from
              <span class="highlight">preconceived notions</span> of proper business etiquette.
