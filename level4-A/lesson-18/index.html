          <div class="article">
            Makoto Deguchi, a sales rep in the Overseas Sales Division of his company, drafted a major contract
            proposal for a leading French car manufacturer. When Makoto <span class="highlight">pitched</span> his
            five-year proposal to the
            French purchasing manager, Daniel Lacroix, the response was far from what he had hoped for.

          <div class="row">

            <div class="col">
              <p>
                We are absolutely interested in a long-lasting partnership with Makoto’s company, so I do
                not see the logic in tying us to a formal, multi-year contract. If anything, the contract
                seems to emphasize Makoto’s distrust and lack of confidence in our partnership. If his
                company’s product quality is <span class="highlight">up to snuff</span>, they have nothing to worry
                about.
              </p>

            <div class="col">
              <p>
                This is confusing. My five-year proposal is very <span class="highlight">favorable</span> for Daniel’s
                company. I included
                everything — from product training, logistics and inventory management, to a 15%
                discount for large orders. I wanted to create a long-lasting, win-win partnership, but
                Daniel is still unwilling to sign the contract. His actions, requests, and words don’t match.

          <div class="article">
            Makoto’s efforts seemed <span class="highlight">in vain</span> and his hopes for signing Daniel’s company
            became less and less
            likely. Though both parties have similar goals, distinct cultural approaches have negatively impacted
            the relationship of the parties involved and may ultimately jeopardize the growth of both companies.
