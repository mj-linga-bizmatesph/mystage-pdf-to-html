              Jun Aikawa, an employee of the Procurement Department, scheduled an emergency telephone meeting at
              <span class="highlight">8PM sharp</span> with Raj Sharma, his contact in Mumbai, India, to discuss yet another delayed delivery of key parts. Raj calls 23 minutes late, with no apology,
              action plan, or sense of urgency — infuriating Jun.
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col"><p class="b name">Jun</p></div>
              <div class="col">
                <p>
                  This is the second delay we’ve had in three months. With the way things are going, we may not be able to meet our production quota. We need those parts. I can’t understand Raj’s
                  business style. I have little use and time for small talk, excuses, and half-measures. We need a capable supplier with good <span class="highlight">accountability</span> and a solid
                  business continuity plan.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col"><p class="b name">Raj</p></div>
              <div class="col">
                <p>
                  Jun wants <span class="highlight">contingency</span> plans and solutions for everything. Unfortunately, there are just some things we just can’t predict or control. The labor strike
                  that caused the delay was unavoidable. The only thing we can do is remain flexible and handle the problems as they come. Getting angry doesn’t help the issue. Jun should try to
                  understand this.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="article">
              While another delayed delivery of key parts is indeed a problem, Jun and Raj’s inability to see eye to eye poses a more serious threat. As business often depends on the successful
              collaboration between people and organizations, Jun and Raj may have to tackle the more <span class="highlight">pressing issue</span> between them.
