              Some of us were taught that winning isn’t everything; it’s how hard we try that counts. However, in the business world, some companies
              <span class="highlight">place much more weight on results</span>
              than the process. The first dimension of organizational culture explores this further.

            <div class="article">
              <div class="label">Goal-oriented:</div>
              In these companies, employees are expected to get results. For some, this style may be very motivating because it allows for a larger degree of flexibility with minimal supervision.
              However, this approach may lead to a win-at-any-cost mentality that encourages <span class="highlight">foul play</span> and short-sightedness.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              <div class="label">Process-oriented:</div>
              In these companies, the journey is more important than the destination; they believe that an efficient, well-defined process eventually gets results. Progress is more easily measured and
              work is more consistent. However, employees locked into strict processes may suffer from a
              <span class="highlight">lack of drive</span> and innovation.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              These two are extremes, and most companies find a balance in between. Some tasks and projects may
              <span class="highlight">thrive</span> in goal-oriented environments, while others from a more process-oriented approach. Knowing which to apply in certain situations ultimately
              contributes to a company’s identity and success.
