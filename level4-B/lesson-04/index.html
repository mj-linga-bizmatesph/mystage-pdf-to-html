              The concept, “the customer is always right” has taken a firm hold in the minds, hearts, and strategies of many businesses. The second dimension of organizational culture classifies
              companies into those that fully <span class="highlight">embrace</span> this idea and those that do not.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              <div class="label">Internally Driven:</div>
              In this type of culture, companies believe they know best. As experts in their field, they don’t allow customers to directly influence business strategy. It is an active approach that
              allows room for innovation and experimentation. Unfortunately, this does not always guarantee customer satisfaction.

            <div class="article">
              <div class="label">Externally Driven:</div>
              In this type of culture, companies believe success lies in effectively reading and responding to the market. Giving customers what they want is their top priority. Although this seems
              <span class="highlight">sensible</span>, failing to provide the best solution due to misinformed requests may have unfortunate consequences.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              As conflicting as these two cultures may seem, they often work hand in hand. Rather than choosing one over the other, companies that are able to successfully combine them to create
              <span class="highlight">synergy</span> will be able to promote innovation and outperform their competition — all while satisfying client needs.
