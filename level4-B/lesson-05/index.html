            Rules, regulations, and codes of conduct are things we’ve all been brought up to respect and follow. Our
            third dimension of culture recognizes that the application and <span class="highlight">adherence</span> to
            certain rules and regulations vary from company to company, thus creating a unique environment.

            <div class="label">Easy-going Discipline:</div>
            In easy-going companies, rules are loose and employees are given lots of
            <span class="highlight">leeway</span> in how they manage their time and work. They believe that strict
            guidelines serve only to limit people’s creativity. However, the resulting uncertainty and need to improvise
            may also result in work inconsistency and inefficiency.

          <div class="article">
            <div class="label">Strict discipline:</div>
            In strict companies, employees are guided by rules, supervised closely, and given clear directions. They
            believe that these enhance consistency, efficiency, and control among the staff. On the other hand, this may
            also limit their employees’ ability to <span class="highlight">think on their feet</span> and adapt to
            changing conditions.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            Degrees of discipline vary from industry to industry. However, an important thing to remember is that great
            corporate culture successfully aligns corporate vision, mission, and values, with employee growth and
            development. The result is an environment that <span class="highlight">fosters</span> both excellence and
            profitability.
