            <span class="highlight">Picture this</span>: someone asks you, “What do you do for a living?” What would you
            say? Do you begin with your company’s name or your job title? Although there is no wrong answer, the
            difference in how individuals identify themselves as employees establishes the fourth dimension of
            organizational culture.

          <div class="article">
            <div class="label">Local:</div>
            Employees in local cultures see themselves as part of a team and focus on developing close relationships,
            sharing information, and camaraderie. However, due to the intimate nature of this culture, personal
            conflicts with colleagues and office politics can <span class="highlight">run rampant</span> if left
            unchecked.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <div class="label">Professional:</div>
            Employees in professional cultures see themselves as specialists assigned to specific tasks. As work is
            often project-based, employees are able to focus on the work itself without worrying about politics and
            long-lasting relationships. However, issues may arise from the resulting lack of
            <span class="highlight">cohesion</span>, frequent headhunting, and turnovers.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            As businesses continue to expand overseas, many local companies are finding the need to become more
            professional in their approach. Working on multiple international projects with different people is becoming
            the <span class="highlight">norm</span> — thus, the need to adopt different business styles becomes more
            apparent.
