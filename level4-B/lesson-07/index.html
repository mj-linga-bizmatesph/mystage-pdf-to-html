            In a world full of different ethnicities and cultures, <span class="highlight">segregation</span> is a
            challenge that many face. So too, in business. Though some companies are more welcoming than others, fitting
            in isn’t always easy. The fifth dimension of culture explores how easily companies accept new staff into the
            workplace.

          <div class="article">
            <div class="label">Open Systems:</div>
            In open companies, newcomers are quickly welcomed. Staff and managers show a great deal of patience to
            newcomers, who quickly feel at ease. However, rookies may see themselves as being 
            <span class="highlight">on equal footing</span> with everyone else, which could lead to confusion or
            disrespectful behaviour.

          <div class="article">
            <div class="label">Closed Systems:</div>
            In closed companies, newcomers are viewed with suspicion. Breaking the ice is tough and newcomers need to
            prove themselves. Surviving this difficult transition period can boost performance, but the lack of
            acceptance, <span class="highlight">camaraderie</span>, and access to information may result in animosity
            and distrust.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            Oftentimes, new employees are seen as overly soft, dependent, and lacking in real-world experience. Some
            might think that an open approach would be ideal, but others claim that a closed approach would more
            effectively <span class="highlight">put new hires in their place</span> and better prepare them for what
            lies ahead.
