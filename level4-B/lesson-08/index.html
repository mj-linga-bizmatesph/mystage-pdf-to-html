              Most companies <span class="highlight">swear by</span> the saying, “People are your greatest asset,” only to
              lay off chunks of their workforce when business goes down. The sixth dimension of organizational culture
              differentiates between companies that value staff welfare more than productivity, and those that prioritize
              results over their workforce.

            <div class="article">
              <div class="label">Employee-oriented:</div>
              In this culture, companies believe that satisfied employees lead to higher productivity. Employees are seen
              as individuals, and managers take great care in looking after their staff. However, employees could easily
              fall into <span class="highlight">mediocrity</span> as managers try to do what they can to protect their
              subordinates — even poor performers.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              <div class="label">Work-oriented:</div>
              In this culture, employees are expected to perform well — and face the consequences if they do not. The
              office environment is far more impersonal but order is maintained more easily. Unfortunately, this has a way
              of <span class="highlight">cultivating</span> distrust among colleagues and deepening the divide between
              managers and staff.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Although employee welfare and company productivity may sometimes appear to be at conflict with each other,
              these two things are not <span class="highlight">mutually exclusive</span>. A company cannot survive by
              neglecting one or the other, and success is more easily attainable through the careful consideration of both
              sides.
