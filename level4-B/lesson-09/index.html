            How employees view their leaders and how strongly they identify with corporate vision and philosophy are
            <span class="highlight">quintessential</span> to the culture of the company. Our final two dimensions of

            <div class="label">High Versus Low Acceptance of Leadership:</div>
            In high-acceptance companies, employees are very receptive to management
            <span class="highlight">mandates</span>. They aspire to climb the ladder and respect their leaders greatly.
            On the other hand, low-acceptance companies tend to have strict regulations, shaky morale, and a
            high-pressure workplace. As a result, employees typically form unions to express their frustration and
            create change.

          <div class="article">
            <div class="label">Strong Versus Weak Company Identification:</div>
            In companies with strong identification, employees embrace corporate philosophies, see themselves as one
            with the company, and have a strong sense of ownership. <span class="highlight">On the flip side</span>, in
            companies with weak identification, employees may be less loyal to the company and are more driven by
            short-term, monetary gains.

          <div class="article">
            It is said that people don’t leave jobs; they leave managers. By adopting effective leadership styles that
            synergize corporate philosophies with business goals and employee motivations, companies can ensure that
            positivity, efficiency, and loyalty <span class="highlight">reverberate</span> throughout the business.
