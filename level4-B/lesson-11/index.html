              When Tim arrived on his first day of work, Randy, his manager, had explained that everyone is like family,
              and that he shouldn’t hesitate to ask for assistance. Tim’s colleagues have been very warm and helpful, but
              Tim seems to have <span class="highlight">taken asking for help too far</span>, frustrating some of his
              coworkers.

                  It’s been three months since Tim has joined, and it hasn’t exactly been
                  <span class="highlight">smooth sailing</span>. He’s always asking others for help, which is fine, but he
                  never helps them in return. His excuse is always, “I don’t know how to do that yet.” His casual and
                  upfront approach also comes across as being a bit rude sometimes. I’d better talk to him about his
                  attitude.

                  I just talked with Randy and he told me that people are concerned about my work and behavior. I thought
                  I could rely on the others to help me out while I <span class="highlight">learn the ropes!</span> Why
                  are they complaining? How can I help when I’m still so new? Randy said to treat everyone in the company
                  like family and that’s what I’ve been doing. So what’s wrong?

              Tim was <span class="highlight">shaken</span>. At first, he felt right at home, but after his talk with
              Randy, he began to feel more and more uncomfortable with his duties and colleagues. He felt pressured to
              perform and wasn’t sure how to interact with the others. What once was a promising start had become
              something else entirely.

            Imagine you are Randy. A new employee has joined the company. You want to avoid the same problems you had with
            Tim, but still want to maintain a friendly, and welcoming atmosphere. Greet the new staff.
