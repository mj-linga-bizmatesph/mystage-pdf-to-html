              James, a lead programmer at a major IT company, was looking for new work. One day, an old friend e-mailed
              him to ask if he wanted to join her small IT start-up. James, confident in his abilities and wanting to try
              something new, jumped at the chance — <span class="highlight">oblivious</span> to the challenges that lay
              ahead.

                  I knew working for a venture company would be challenging, but I didn’t expect this. Things are moving
                  at such <span class="highlight">breakneck speeds</span> that I’m finding it hard to keep up. There’s no
                  standardization, tight deadlines, lots of overtime, and on top of that, I’m handling much more than just
                  IT. Sales, customer service — everything. I can’t take much more…

                  We’re trying to create something from nothing. This takes time, dedication, blood, sweat, and tears. In
                  big companies, it’s easy to delegate. They have money, people, systems, and procedures for everything.
                  But here, we’re <span class="highlight">flying by the seat of our pants</span>. James has been in a
                  traditional company his whole life. It’s no wonder things are hard for him.

              Changes in procedures, environment, people, and culture have made adapting to Talia’s company a tiring
              <span class="highlight">endeavour</span> for James. Although there are many opportunities for professional
              and personal growth at his post, all the stress he is experiencing makes him wonder if he made the right
              choice. with the others. What once was a promising start had become something else entirely.

            Imagine you are James. Talia’s business needs more staff as it is growing very rapidly. You are meeting with
            your ex-coworkers who are interested in joining. Tell them about the work, the culture, and the pros and cons
            of working for a venture.
