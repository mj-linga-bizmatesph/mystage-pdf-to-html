            Kim, the new president of Ace Pharma, had a tough road ahead of her. Sales was steadily decreasing, morale
            was low, and product development was in a rut. With Bob, head of HR, Kim was hoping to
            <span class="highlight">reinvigorate</span> the company. However, the problems may be more deeply rooted
            than Kim realized.

                The problems we’re facing lies in the DNA of Ace’s corporate culture. We need to reframe our approach
                and our values. The staff have gotten used to mediocrity and we’ve been relying on our past successes
                for too long. We hope things will improve because of our history and product quality, but hoping is not
                enough. It’s time to start <span class="highlight">shaking things up</span>.

                I feel people are generally pretty happy. We treat everyone like family and our products have always
                been better than the rest. Until recently, we have never had to worry about sales. It’s great of Kim to
                hand out new vision cards, organize customer-focused seminars, and give speeches, but changing decades
                of culture is an <span class="highlight">uphill battle</span>.

            Six months passed and despite Kim’s best efforts, the employees of Ace Pharma remained
            <span class="highlight">apathetic</span> to her campaign. Most of them had lost their vision cards,
            neglected customer focus, and had no sense of urgency. In an effort to demonstrate the seriousness of their
            situation, Kim began to consider layoffs.
