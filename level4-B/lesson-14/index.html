              Jennifer, an IT consultant, is heading a project for a large insurance company to
              <span class="highlight">consolidate</span> the IT processes of each region. The project requires her and her team to meet with the managers from each area to better understand their
              needs and business. Unfortunately, things are not going well.

                  Even though we’re experts, we’ve never faced such a tough job. Their regional managers are very resistant and we’re not getting the cooperation and information we need. The company
                  has been so lax on rules that each region has developed and settled into their own processes over the years. Standardizing everything is a <span class="highlight">tall order</span>,
                  given the situation.

                  Jennifer’s team is very impersonal and it’s hard to work with people we can’t connect with. They understand very little about our business yet the consultants are uninterested in
                  anything other than their own areas of expertise. My region has developed its own process and I think it works well. The other regions feel the same. Why do we need this?

              The atmosphere is tense and the project is
              <span class="highlight">falling apart</span>. The regional managers have filed an official complaint to top management stating they had lost all confidence in Jennifer and her team’s
              ability to develop a workable system. The project <span class="highlight">hangs in the balance</span> and Jennifer is at a loss.
