              Matt Swift, the founder of 1UP, a successful fashion-forward brand for teens, recently merged with Globe, a national apparel company with a great distribution network that has been
              struggling in the youth market. Although it seemed to be a perfect match, it didn’t take long for things to <span class="highlight">go south</span>.
            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col"><p class="b name">Matt</p></div>
              <div class="col">
                <p>
                  I started 1UP with very clear values: freedom, creativity, and passion. We became the best because it was never about money or business – it was about fashion. I thought Globe
                  understood that, but I was wrong. Our values have been
                  <span class="highlight">stripped away</span> and now we are told to focus on cutting costs at the expense of quality, and increasing quantity at the expense of integrity.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="col"><p class="b name">William</p></div>
              <div class="col">
                <p>
                  I was brought in to make sure 1UP gets in line with Globe’s standards. This is a business, and it’s my job to make sure 1UP doesn’t become a liability and hurt our bottom lines.
                  They’re not seeing the big picture. I might not be a
                  <span class="highlight">fashionista</span> but I know numbers. They need to understand that sometimes sacrifices have to be made in order to grow.

              With this shift, many of the top designers that Matt hired personally are on the verge of leaving the company. They loved 1UP, Matt, and fashion — but Globe represented none of this. To
              them, what once was a free-spirited, edgy fashion line has become yet another <span class="highlight">cog</span> in a large corporate machine.
