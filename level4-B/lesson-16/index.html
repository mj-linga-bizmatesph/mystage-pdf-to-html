              Hiroshi had been headhunted by a medium-sized real estate company to turn their
              <span class="highlight">floundering</span> sales department around. The previous sales director had been way
              too easy on the team and Hiroshi felt a total change was needed. Although performance was improving, his
              tactics made many uncomfortable.

                  In order to make big improvements, we need to make big changes. We can no longer
                  <span class="highlight">beat around the bush</span>. If you’re not helping or improving, you’re hurting
                  the team. Yes, my style has forced some people to leave, but that’s the point. We need strong and
                  capable people. For the first time in many months, numbers are going up. This is what I do.

                  As head of HR, I’m responsible for the welfare of our employees. Many have come to me complaining about
                  Hiroshi’s <span class="highlight">draconian</span> policies and some have even gone so far as to call it
                  power harassment. I don’t care what his sales targets are; we don’t support yelling, banging on tables,
                  and embarrassing and ranking people in front of others. This must stop.

              Sarah confronted Hiroshi about his management style and warned him to change his methods or risk severe
              consequences. Hiroshi was shocked and couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He had been hired to realign the
              Sales Department, not to maintain it. Now Hiroshi is <span class="highlight">at a loss</span> for what to
              do.
