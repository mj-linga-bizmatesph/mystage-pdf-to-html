            TeraCom is on the verge of bankruptcy. Its previous presidents spent
            <span class="highlight">lavishly</span>, invested foolishly, and lost sight of TeraCom’s core business. Wes
            Blair, the managing director cum president, has been tasked to turn things around. Unfortunately, not
            everyone is convinced that Wes is right for the job.

                We need to find ourselves. Decades of overspending have put us in a dangerous financial state. We need
                to take a long, serious look at cost reduction and offload anything unrelated to our core business. We
                lost ourselves by <span class="highlight">jumping on bandwagons</span>, pursuing unnecessary
                acquisitions, and ignoring real issues. It’s time I bring us back to basics.

                Wes has worked closely with every president before him. He’s been there for every bad decision and every
                misguided acquisition that’s put us in this situation. As an insider, he should’ve had this revelation
                years ago. Now that things are really bad, he <span class="highlight">has the gall to</span> tell us
                we’ve been doing things wrong? He’s been part of the problem the whole time.

            Unsurprisingly, many staff members and executives reacted negatively to Wes’
            <span class="highlight">chest-thumping</span>. Many felt that he was hypocritical and lacked accountability.
            Though Wes has every intention of righting the company, he has a long way to go in gaining the support he
            needs from the other executives and staff.

          Imagine you are attending a board meeting to discuss whom to appoint as the next company President. On one
          hand, you have Wes Blair, a 30-year veteran of the company with extensive internal knowledge. On the other
          hand, you have an outsider with equal experience, but he/ she is unfamiliar with the company’s history and
          culture. Which of the two would you recommend for the position?
