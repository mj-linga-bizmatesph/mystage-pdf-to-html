              Dennis, a 35-year-old manager at a small, family-owned restaurant for 12 years, left his job to become a management trainee at Eats, Inc. — one of the largest restaurant chains in the
              country. He was excited to start his OJT with Frank, his new manager. However, what happened next

                  I thought I signed up for restaurant management, not the army. Are you serious? We have to recite the company vision every morning? No wonder the turnover rate is so high here. I
                  understand the need to standardize but this level of

              Initially, Dennis was impressed by the training, facilities, and professionalism. However, the overly-rigid culture of the company made him question his decision to join Eats. At his
              previous job, he handled everything from hiring to cooking to inventory; here, he was just a glorified
