            Ann, a consultant and MBA holder, was recruited to Watts, a medium-sized electrical parts supplier, as
            project manager. Although Watts prided itself on being a family business with local sensibilities, the hopes
            of taking the business national put Ann <span class="highlight">at the forefront</span>, much to the dismay
            of the local staff.

                We’re going to have to make big changes if we want to go national. This means implementing a clear chain
                of command, delegating key responsibilities, cutting low performers, and setting KPIs. Unfortunately,
                people aren’t cooperating. The team is exceeding budget, missing targets, and making decisions without
                me. I’m <span class="highlight">dumbstruck</span>!

                I don’t think Ann gets how things go around here. The concepts, theories, and systems she’s introduced
                are confusing everyone. On top of that, she just sits there
                <span class="highlight">on her high horse</span> giving orders without putting in any work herself.
                That’s not how we do things around here. We all pitch in, take care of each other, and focus on
                teamwork.

            Raj approached Ann to inform her that the team is having trouble with her particular style of management and
            has <span class="highlight">signed a petition</span> to have her replaced as project manager. Ann was
            shocked at their inability to see the bigger picture — her job was to make sure things got done, not baby
            the staff.

          Imagine you are president of Watts. You received the petition from Raj, but are unwilling to replace Ann as
          project manager. Convince Raj in whatever way you feel is best to ensure the team’s cooperation.
