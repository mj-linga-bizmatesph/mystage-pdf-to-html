              The question, “What do you do?” is something one is often asked when meeting people for the first time. Although we are more than our professions suggest, it is undeniable that our
              occupation and its culture have
              <span class="highlight">significant</span> impacts on our identity and how we are perceived by others.

            <div class="article">
              Every organization has its own occupational culture, which is defined as the patterns of thought and behaviour shared by members of the same profession. Occupational culture can be
              further categorized into three <span class="highlight">subcultures</span>:
              <ul>
                <li><span class="b">Operators – </span>Those who are directly involved with their company’s products and services</li>
                <li><span class="b">Engineers – </span>Those who are directly involved with technology, finance, data, and information</li>
                <li><span class="b">Executives – </span>Those that oversee the company and its major processes</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              By observing the <span class="highlight">jargon</span>, morals, <span class="highlight">outlooks</span>, practices, and traditions that people with similar occupations share, one may
              develop a deeper understanding of certain business cultures, gain unique professional insights, and discover new avenues for success.
