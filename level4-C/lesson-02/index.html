            The first thing to consider when exploring occupational culture is the amount of know-how needed for a
            particular job. Certain occupations may require expert-level knowledge whereas others may require less. This
            <span class="highlight">ultimately</span> affects everything, from group association to retention and
            identity.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <p class="sub-text b"><u>Esoteric knowledge</u></p>
            Highly specialized knowledge often takes years of dedication, training, and patience to acquire. As a
            result, those who have <span class="highlight">persevered</span> are likely to develop high levels of pride,
            become more involved with their work, and develop a strong sense of belonging to their particular
            occupation.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <p class="sub-text b"><u>General knowledge</u></p>
            Occupations that require less specialized knowledge and a more generic understanding of basic business
            processes may result in a culture that is more process-oriented. This work style may lead to easier
            adjustment periods but <span class="highlight">a higher degree of turnover and interchangeability.</span>
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            Regardless of the degree of <span class="highlight">proficiency</span> one’s profession requires, it is also
            important to note that knowledge opens doors to opportunities. However, it is the effective application of
            that knowledge that enables us to turn opportunities into success.
