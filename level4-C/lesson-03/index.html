              Emotional demand is the need to effectively recognize, interpret, and react to different emotions and <span class="highlight">mental states</span> in order to accomplish certain tasks at
              work. While some tasks and jobs require high amounts of emotional demand, other jobs require less in order to succeed.

              <p class="sub-text b"><u>High Emotional Demand:</u></p>
              Occupations with high emotional demand require emotional sensitivity, interpersonal skills and the ability to create the appropriate atmosphere best suited to the job. People belonging
              to this occupational group must <span class="highlight">be adept at</span> empathizing with others, reading between the lines, and managing people.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              <p class="sub-text b"><u>Low Emotional Demand:</u></p>
              Occupations belonging to this group require little in terms of social interaction or relationship management in order to perform well. Too much unnecessary emotion may have a negative
              impact on people in these jobs as it distracts from the task at hand, creates unwanted biases, and <span class="highlight">saps</span> energy.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Emotions are an <span class="highlight">inevitable</span> part of any career, job, or professional pursuit. Therefore, it is important to know when, why, and how much one must be
              emotionally invested in one’s occupation in order to define one’s occupational culture and one’s identity within it.
