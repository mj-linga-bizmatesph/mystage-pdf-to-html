            In the office, it is not unusual for some to view those belonging to different <span
              class="highlight">vocations</span> as outsiders. Despite being in the same company, unique occupational
            cultures emerge from the different responsibilities, mentalities, motivations, and levels of pride each
            employee has.

            <p class="sub-text b"><u>High Occupational Identification:</u></p>
            Those with high degrees of occupational identification are dedicated, loyal, and emotionally attached to
            their work. Good as this may be, an excessive amount of pride due to high identification may also result in
            adversity and suspicion towards other occupations, causing internal <span class="highlight">rifts</span> and
            conflict.

          <div class="article">
            <p class="sub-text b"><u>Low Occupational Identification:</u></p>
            Employees with low levels of occupational identification are driven by simpler motivations when compared to
            those with high occupational identity. Although they might not have the highest amount of attachment to
            their work, they are typically classified as rational, pragmatic, and <span

          <div class="article">
            In any organization, divisions are made <b>apparent</b> by its employees’ differing levels of occupational
            identification. Nonetheless, it is important to keep in mind the big picture: that no matter how superior
            one’s profession may seem when compared to another, a company achieves more when its employees work
            together.
