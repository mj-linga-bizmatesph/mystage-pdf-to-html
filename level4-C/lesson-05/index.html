            As the saying goes, “It’s not what you know, but who you know”. In some jobs, this expression more or less
            <span class="highlight">sums up</span> the hiring process. In other words, no matter how qualified you are
            for a certain position, you may not even get the opportunity to apply for it unless you know the right
            people.

            <p class="sub-text b"><u>Closed Occupations:</u></p>
            In closed occupations, the chances of landing the job are incredibly slim unless you have the right
            connections and recommendations. The job is typically very exclusive, highly sought-after, and only for
            those lucky enough to have access to elite circles. Certain executive positions may <span

          <div class="article">
            <p class="sub-text b"><u>Open Occupations:</u></p>
            Most jobs are open occupations as they are offered to the most qualified candidates. <span
              class="highlight">Competency</span> assessments, background checks, and interviews allow companies to
            screen for the person best fit for the job regardless of their connections. The post is open to the public
            and anyone can apply.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            Although closed occupational culture is far less <span class="highlight">prevalent</span> in hiring, we can
            never underestimate the value of having a wide network. As the business world and its professionals become
            increasingly connected, knowing the right people can often lead to once-in-a-lifetime employment
            opportunities.
