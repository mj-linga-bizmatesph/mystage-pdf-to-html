            Advances in technology have resulted in countless can’t-live-without conveniences. As a result, new occupations centered around IT have <span class="highlight">flourished</span> and grown rapidly. That being said, certain careers less focused on technology have still managed to stay relevant despite these advancements.

            <p class="sub-text b"><u>Modern Occupations:</u></p>
            Modern occupations are newly created jobs that typically require a unique set of technological skills that are high in demand. These jobs are often linked to the development or rise of some new technology or trend. Big data analysts and <span class="highlight">AI</span> developers are just a couple examples of this.

          <div class="article">
            <p class="sub-text b"><u>Traditional Occupations:</u></p>
            Traditional occupations are fairly <span class="highlight">resilient</span> to changing conditions and have been around for decades. Although technology may affect the way certain tasks are carried out, the occupation itself remains relatively unchanged. These jobs tend to be linked with the arts or humanities in one form or another.

            Although certain traditional occupations have <span class="highlight">stood the test of time</span>, the constant emergence of new technology is forcing many to consider the stability of their careers. That being said, even though technology is a major driving force in today’s business world, it alone cannot determine success.
