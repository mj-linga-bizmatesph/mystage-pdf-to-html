            In some jobs, employees may be required to collaborate with many people in order to be successful and happy.
            That being said, certain other occupations require little to no collaboration with others. This <span
              class="highlight">disparity</span> in the office environment forms very different cultures within
            occupations.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <p class="sub-text b"><u>Social Occupations:</u></p>
            In these jobs, the office is more than just a space to work. It’s a place where people come to share ideas,
            find inspiration, support each other, and build relationships. Collaboration, team work, and communication
            are all <span class="highlight">highly regarded</span> and the environment has a huge impact on job
            satisfaction.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <p class="sub-text b"><u>Private Occupations:</u></p>
            In these jobs, there is little need for continual support and collaboration. Defined by high degrees of
            flexibility and the ability to work from anywhere means private occupations place high amounts of value on
            freedom, <span class="highlight">determination</span>, and self-expression.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            The rise in flex time, telecommuting, and home-based start-ups have given people more opportunities to
            experience the lifestyle of a private occupation. Despite the conveniences that come with private
            occupations, some have found it difficult <span class="highlight">to cope with the lack of social
            interaction</span>.
