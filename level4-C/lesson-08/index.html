            Almost every industry, company, and occupation has its own peak and non-peak season. However, in some jobs,
            these <span class="highlight">peaks and valleys</span> are so extreme that during the busy season, some
            people live completely different lives. On the other hand, certain other occupations offer much more
            stability.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <p class="sub-text b"><u>Constant Occupations:</u></p>
            These occupations have ongoing daily duties that keep their employees busy. However, every now and then,
            these occupations need to put in additional overtime hours <span class="highlight">when things get
              hairy</span>. Yet, on the whole, constant occupational culture allows for a fairly balanced lifestyle.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            <p class="sub-text b"><u>Seasonal Occupations:</u></p>
            For seasonal occupations, work schedules are much more extreme. During the on-season, some may be away from
            home for months at a time or working daily 16-hour shifts, resulting in <span
              class="highlight">enormous</span> physical and mental stress. On the other hand, when things are slow,
            they are basically without work.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            Missing loved ones’ birthdays, <span class="highlight">recitals</span>, and graduations may seem like a high
            price to pay for people in seasonal occupations. However, seasonal job holders often have a better work-life
            balance and tend to value the time with their family during the off-season more than constant job holders.
