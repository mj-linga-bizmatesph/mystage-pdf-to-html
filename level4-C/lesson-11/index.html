              StandOut, a medium-sized electronics company, has been struggling to retain their competitive edge. 
              As a result, the product team has been tasked with designing something that will <span class="highlight">put them back on the map</span>. 
              Unfortunately, StandOut’s product and marketing heads aren’t seeing eye to eye.

                  As head of the product team, I believe we need to innovate. Up to now, we’ve been looking at data and designing our products around nothing but research and numbers. 
                  People don’t really know what they want, and no matter how much data we have, there’s more to design and innovation than numbers and studies. 
                  We need to <span class="highlight">push the envelope</span>.

                  It’s all about making something people want. Henry wants to be the next Steve Jobs but he needs to <span class="highlight">keep his ambition in check</span>. 
                  We can’t afford to guess at what people want; that’s why we have data. 
                  Henry doesn’t need to understand all the nuances of marketing and research, but I do expect him to put his ego aside and work with us.

              StandOut’s brand is <span class="highlight">waning</span> and something must be done to get things back on track. 
              However, the first order of business may be to ensure that a more cooperative atmosphere exists between Henry’s and Trevor’s sections. 
              After all, there is no strength without unity and no success without cooperation.
