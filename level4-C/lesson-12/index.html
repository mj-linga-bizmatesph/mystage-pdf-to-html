              Rina was assigned to oversee operations and improve the situation at her company’s overseas factory. 
              Turnover and quality have been constant issues, so in order to <span class="highlight">get a feel for things</span> at the factory, 
              Rina sat down with Mark, the previous manager, and Rob, one of the current staff.

                  Where I come from, a job is a job. No matter what you do, you have to <span class="highlight">give it your all</span>! The culture here is different from what I’m used to. We should be proud of our work, but I had seen little in terms of loyalty and work ethics. Everyone should’ve followed orders and respected the chain of command but that wasn’t the case. It was frustrating.

                  “Do this. Do that.” We’re just army ants to Mark. There isn’t much keeping us here except for the pay. Anyone can do what we do, so I feel totally <span class="highlight">expendable</span>. Is it a surprise that I don’t feel any sort of attachment to the work, the people, or the company? That being said, If there are better opportunities somewhere else, I’m gone.

              Working relationships can be hard to manage, especially when there are such large differences in motivation and culture. Even though Mark was very loyal and dedicated to his work, the local staff had remained <span class="highlight">indifferent</span>. Rina will have to take a different approach if the situation is to improve.

            Imagine you are Rina. After hearing Mark’s and Rob’s viewpoints, you need to report your findings back to your boss. 
            Once you’ve finished reporting the situation, brainstorm some ideas with your boss to resolve the issue.
