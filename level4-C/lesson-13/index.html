              Cam is part of the Customer Support Team at a company specializing in developing office software. Recently, there have been large spikes in the amount of complaints after the release of
              a major patch from the Engineering Department. Although Cam doesn’t like to complain, this time he <span class="highlight">lost his cool</span>.

                  Dealing with angry customers is torture. They yell, scream, and often forget that we’re people, too. The sad part is, there’s nothing we can do about it. We’re constantly cleaning up
                  other people’s mistakes and get very little recognition for what we do. I want to help by giving suggestions to Engineering but they don’t take me seriously. I’m
                  <span class="highlight">sick of it</span>.

                  As programmers, we need to write and <span class="highlight">scour through thousands of lines of code</span>. So, it’s expected that we encounter some bugs at launch. It’s not like
                  we put the bugs in there on purpose! What we do is very complex and Cam’s “suggestions” don’t help. We know what the issues are. Dealing with clients is his job, coding is mine —
                  let’s leave it at that.

              <span class="highlight">Tensions</span> began to rise soon after the launch, the CS Team and the Engineering Department began communicating less and less. Cam, in particular, started to
              feel more and more like an undervalued punching bag. He had accepted his fate and gave up on trying to improve the situation.
