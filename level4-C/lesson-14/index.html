              The first smart contact lenses, manufactured by SmarT, were finally approved, and factories were working non-stop to meet deadlines. After a wildly successful launch, 
              <span class="highlight">rave reviews</span>, and huge profits, SmarT’s CEO gave Johan, the talented inventor, a large bonus, while the factory workers, to their disappointment, received nothing.

                  They’re just blue-collars. All they do is follow simple instructions, push some buttons, and pull some levers. Robots can do that. My development team and I are the real reason why this project was such a smashing success. So, why do they deserve more? They got their overtime pay and now they want more? That’s just being greedy.

We deserve more respect. What’s more, we demand a formal apology and a 10% increase in wages. After all, the company can afford it now. If not, we’re striking. We’ll see how valuable we are then.
