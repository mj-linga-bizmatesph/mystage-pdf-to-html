              X-Motors, a family-owned business that builds custom cars, is a wonderful place to work. Everyone is friendly, especially Cesar, one of X-Motors’ pioneer employees. He is a role model and <span class="highlight">father figure</span> to many of the staff. Although business has been slow, morale remained high thanks to Cesar’s efforts.

                  I think of everyone here like family. They’re all like my sons and daughters. Especially Hiro, the President’s son. I watched him grow and taught him everything there is to know about cars. Now, he’s managing our shop like a pro. I know business has been slow, but we’ll get through it. As long as we stick together, we’ll <span class="highlight">come out the other end</span> okay.

                  Everyone is working hard and keeping their spirits up, but we’re <span class="highlight">hemorrhaging</span> money. Badly. Father is telling me to start reducing costs by laying off our senior staff. Some of these people, like Cesar, have been with us for more than 35 years. I tried talking Father out of it, but he said I shouldn’t let emotions get in the way of good business decisions.

              Hiro’s father has always been a tough business man who was always better with numbers than with people. Hiro, however, is <span class="highlight">a man of the people</span> and couldn’t be more different. The future of X-Motors and the careers of loyal staff like Cesar hang in the balance, and Hiro is stuck in the middle.
