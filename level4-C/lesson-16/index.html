              Profits fell another 15% at Surge, a mid-sized semiconductor manufacturer. Morale is low, and the executives are wondering where to place the blame. An emergency meeting is called and
              what started off as a typical meeting soon became
              <span class="highlight">a heated exchange</span> between Marketing and Sales.

                <p>
                  Marketing sets up the potential customers and Sales is supposed to knock them down. We’ve been working hard to promote our brand but the salespeople are failing
                  to <span class="highlight"> capitalize on our efforts</span>. They’re more worried about personal quotas and bonuses than simply closing the deal. It’s the busy season so they’d
                  better start sharing leads, helping each other, and communicating more.

                <p>
                  Marketing keeps accusing us of not working as a team, but all they do is spend company money. If they care so much about sharing, why not hand over some of their budget? We’re
                  <span class="highlight">stretched thin</span> and we need more resources. Bonne has no idea how tough sales is. We’re the ones dealing with people face to face. We don’t get to hide
                  in the office.

              As each side <span class="highlight">entrenches</span> themselves deeper and deeper into their positions, the infighting became worse and worse. Pride, stubbornness, and blame shifting
              has damaged the relationship between the two departments. A solution must be found quickly if the situation is to recover.
