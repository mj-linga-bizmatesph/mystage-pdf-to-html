              Carla is the new office manager at DataSys. Her experience, charisma, and close relationship with the founder landed her the position as well as the support of the president himself. Upon starting, Carla began proposing and implementing bold new office policies, resulting in a jarring transition that <span class="highlight">rubbed many staff the wrong way</span>.

                  My experience in call centers has <span class="highlight">granted</span> me unique insights into things like privacy and efficiency. So, as manager, I decided to make changes. All personal items, including phones and bags, are to be kept on a separate floor to prevent information leakage. I’ll also start recording how much time everyone spends on their PCs and what they’re doing.

                  I’ve been at DataSys for decades and this is the first time that anyone has said privacy and efficiency is a problem. I know Carla is eager to impress and she
                  <span class="highlight">has the ear</span> of the president, but she should be more respectful to her seniors. We’re proud of our work. Carla might be our “boss,” but she needs to prove herself before we can trust her.

              Although the staff were initially eager to have a fresh face in the office, their excitement soon turned to frustration as Carla began imposing more and more of her ideas on the staff. Unaware of the situation and emboldened by her title and the president’s favor, Carla continued to <span class="highlight">rock the boat</span>.
