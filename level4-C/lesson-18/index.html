              Jo, Nina, and Lee had always dreamed of becoming lawyers and opening a practice together. Despite his efforts, Jo was unable to pass the bar exam while the other two 
              <span class="highlight">pressed ahead</span> and started a small firm. Jo, wanting to help, focused his efforts on PR and soon landed a big case for his friends.

                <p>
                  It has been really hard <span class="highlight">getting our practice off the ground</span> so we really appreciate Jo’s work in getting us such a big case. Unfortunately, Jo’s attitude has changed recently. Maybe he’s overcompensating for not passing the bar, but he’s been bossing us around like children. Lee and I are the lawyers. He has no right to tell us what to do.

                  Nina and Lee haven’t been getting much work. If it wasn’t for me, they’d still be settling <span class="highlight">domestic disputes</span> and traffic cases. It’s because of my contacts and me that we landed such a big opportunity. I might not have passed the bar yet, but I know I’m a good leader and I know what needs to be done. Why are they suddenly acting so cold towards me?

            <div class="article">
              At this point, their friendship began to <span class="highlight">sour</span> and their dreams of working together started to crumble. Jo felt like he was constantly looked down on while Nina and Lee began distancing themselves more and more. With everyone’s reputation at risk, the three had better find a way to move forward.
