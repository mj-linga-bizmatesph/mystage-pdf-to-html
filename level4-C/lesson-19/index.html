              Yumi was born into a powerful business family. After returning from her studies in the UK, she was expected to join the family business. However, soon after entering her father’s company, she realized she wanted to <span class="highlight">make her own way in the world</span>. She quit her job and joined a young design firm.

                  I don’t want to be known for my family’s name, but for who I am and what I accomplish. That’s why I joined this “young” company. Who knew it’d be so frustrating? Clients <span class="highlight">have no eye for art</span> at all, and their criticisms are baseless. There’s no more freedom in art than there is at my father’s company! I don’t need more people trying to control me.

                  As a designer myself, I can say that we are a proud group of people. However, as a business person, it’s essential that we respect our client’s opinions. Yumi needs to learn how to accept criticism and remove her pride from the equation. Design is a collaborative process. She’d better learn this quickly if she wants to 
                  <span class="highlight">make any headway</span> here.

            <div class="article">
              Coming from an affluent but confining background has left Yumi with a strong desire for self-expression. Although she has the talent and drive to be successful, the image of being a designer and the true nature of the work left her <span class="highlight">disenchanted</span>, frustrated, and on the verge of giving up.
