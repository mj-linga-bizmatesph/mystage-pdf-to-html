              Gender differences and culture have been hot topics for both men and women for countless centuries.
              In attempts to determine what makes men so different from women, many studies have been
              conducted to <span class="highlight">pinpoint</span> our physical and emotional differences through studies of human evolution,
              genetics, and DNA.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Although the results have provided great insights on the origins of gender-specific behaviours,
              modern-day men and women are <span class="highlight">a far cry from</span> their hunting and gathering ancestors. There may
              have been a time when there were clearer differences between gender roles and culture, but in
              today’s society, it may no longer be appropriate to say that men are poor at multi-tasking because
              they were once hunters and women can’t read maps because their DNA doesn’t allow for it.

              In this rank, we will seek to understand modern-day gender values, perspectives, and what it means
              to be a man and woman in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Although anything from national to occupational culture
              and personal experiences may influence these perspectives, the important thing <span class="highlight">to note</span> is that we,
              as men and women, are always changing – and keeping up with the times is essential for success.
