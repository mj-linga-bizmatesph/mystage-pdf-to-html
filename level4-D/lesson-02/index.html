              Not so long ago, one’s role in society and the values associated with being man or woman were
              <span class="highlight">inseparable</span>. However, as society evolved, people began to break from traditional gender roles and started to develop their own personal values – not as men
              or women, but as individuals.

              <span class="b u">Steven (42) Canadian – President of overseas subsidiary – Who are you and what do you value?<br /></span>
              Who I am and what I value change depending on the role I’m playing. For example, at home, I want to be a loving husband and a caring father. At work, I hope I’m viewed as a
              communicative, charismatic, and
              <span class="highlight">trustworthy</span> leader. In the end, it’s all about taking care of the people I care about.

              <span class="b u">Chika (37) Japanese – Customer service leader – Who are you and what do you value?<br /></span>
              I want people to view me as a
              <span class="highlight">spunky</span> and bright person. To be honest I’m really happy with who I am now. Before, I was unsure of myself because I was trying to be something I’m not, but
              now I feel confident and independent. This is very important. I value my personal growth very much.

              As people, businesses, and nations around the world continue to explore and push the boundaries of traditional gender-specific roles and values, the notions of “be a man” and “act like a
              lady” are becoming less and less relevant, and may one day
              <span class="highlight">vanish</span> entirely.
