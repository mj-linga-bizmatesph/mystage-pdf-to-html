              Our <span class="highlight">worldview</span> is determined by our past experiences, environment, and social interactions. Although science has proven that men and women physically view
              the world differently, how we process that information ultimately determines our unique perspectives as men and women.

              I think I’ve got a lot of choices with where I want to live my life. As a woman though, I feel there’s a lot of pressure. Marriage, family, and my career - all come with certain
              expectations that I have
              <span class="highlight">to contend with</span>. It’s a bit unfair, but it gives me a certain fire that makes me want to rise above it.

              It was, for a lack of a better word, empowering to be brought up as a man. I was told that
              <span class="highlight">the world is my oyster</span>. So, I went out there and lived life on my terms. I’ve got a daughter of my own now, and I’m going to tell her the same. The world
              is something to be challenged and changed for the better.

              Although gender perceptions are evolving, many still
              <span class="highlight">tag</span> female and male perspectives as being two distinct points of view. How we evolve from here will depend on how much we continue to allow external
              pressures impact the way we perceive ourselves, the world, and our gender.
