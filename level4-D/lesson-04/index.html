              Physical differences may be the easiest to
              <span class="highlight">discern</span> when comparing men and
              women. However, in modern, white-collar societies where
              physicality no longer directly determines survival, occupation, or
              status, these differences, however apparent, are becoming less and
              less important.

              I look at those fitness models in magazines and on TV and I wish I
              had an <span class="highlight">8-pack</span>. But I’m an
              accountant, so whatever. However, interestingly enough, my wife
              tells me she likes my belly. She can put her head on it and it
              makes her feel safe. So I guess I have something those models
              don’t have!

              I’m a tough girl. I’ve never felt like I couldn’t do something
              physically. I can do anything a man can do. Nowadays, there are
              female soldiers, fire fighters, and athletes. Some say men are
              still stronger, but mental toughness plays a big part - and mental
              strength <span class="highlight">trumps</span> physical strength
              every time.

              Even though certain physical
              <span class="highlight">traits</span> may still impact one’s
              abilities or status to some degree, much of society has begun to
              look to other things as signs of success and power. And although
              men and women may always be physically different, strength - in a
              modern context - has little to do with muscle.
