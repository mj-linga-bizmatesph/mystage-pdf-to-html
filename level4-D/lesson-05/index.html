              Studies of the brain have revealed some interesting results on gender-specific <span class="highlight">tendencies</span>. However,
              as fascinating as the research is, an MRI analysis of over 1,400 people has found that most brains are a
              combination of both “male” and “female” traits. As a result, we may be more similar than we think.

              <span class="b u">Wayne (24) – British – Grad Student– Would you say your way of thinking is typically male?<br></span>
              If we’re talking about typical male thinking patterns and behavior, I’d say that I <span class="highlight">fit the mould</span> to
              some degree. For example, I like sports, beer with red meat, and looking at girls. On the other hand,
              I’m also very passive; I like cooking and cleaning, and cry when I watch romantic comedies.

              <span class="b u">Emily (35) – Singaporean – Nurse – Would you say your way of thinking is typically female?<br></span>
              Scientific research shows differences in <span class="highlight">grey matter</span>, neural connections, and brain size, but external
              experiences have significant impacts on our psychology. I act a certain way because of the way I was
              treated. If you’re treated like a girl, you start acting like one. I am what the world made me.

              Although psychological differences between genders may make for more interesting <span class="highlight">water cooler
              chat</span>, contrary to popular belief, our similarities vastly outweigh our differences. Though some may
              be content believing that men are men and women are women, the mind is infinitely more complex.
