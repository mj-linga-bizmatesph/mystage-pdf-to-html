              Emotions <span class="highlight">run deep</span> in all people. And although they are received, processed, and expressed differently according to gender, emotions are what make us human.
              That being said, the more interesting question is: are you in control of your emotions, or are they in control of you?

              <span class="b u">Christine (36) – Irish – Lifestyle Coach – How emotional are you?<br /></span>
              My work often requires me <span class="highlight">to be emotionally in tune with the people around me</span>. I teach people to embrace their emotions and not to be afraid of them.
              Feelings never lie. Gender doesn’t play much of a role, in my opinion. Instead, it’s about accepting yourself and knowing when and how much to feel.

              <span class="b u">Hector (40) Spanish – Teacher – How emotional are you?<br /></span>
              I am very emotional. Most people in my country are. It doesn’t matter if they are men or women. It’s nothing to be ashamed of. Happiness, sadness, <span class="highlight">rage</span>,
              peace, all of these things add spice to life. We feel and so we are alive. I believe this is true for men, women, children, animals, and all living things.

            <div class="article">
              In business, some believe that emotions are best <span class="highlight">left at the door</span>. Yet, so much of our motivation, creativity, and relationships are built around our
              ability to feel. So, instead of using emotions as a way of comparing genders, one might see emotion as a way to unite people towards a common cause.
