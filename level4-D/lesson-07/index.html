              It has been said that success and happiness are dependent on the quality of one’s relationships. Yet
              how we build and maintain these relationships are often complex affairs - made even more difficult
              by unpredictable and <span class="highlight">intricate</span> gender dynamics.

              <span class="b u">Megan (27) – Canadian – Flight Attendant – Do you find it easier to work with men or women?<br></span>
              There are much more women than men in my <span class="highlight">line of work</span>. Some are easy to work with and some
              aren’t. No matter where you go, there are office politics… but I noticed when men aren’t around,
              women are a lot more themselves - for better or worse. Work is hard, no matter who you work with.

              <span class="b u">Andrew (50) – Australian – PR Manager– Do you find it easier to work with men or women?<br></span>
              There’s been a lot of great progress made these past years in terms of gender equality at the office.
              That being said, I feel like I need to <span class="highlight">walk on eggshells</span> with some of the female staff. If I’m too
              casual or too tough, it could be misinterpreted as being something else. This has really added to my
              stress.

              Although gender and office politics may impact the way certain individuals behave, it is important to
              remember that the success of any relationship, professional or otherwise, is built upon the <span class="highlight">tenets</span> of
              mutual respect, understanding, and open communication.
