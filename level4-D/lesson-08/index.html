              Humans are social creatures. As a result, our ability to communicate effectively has
              <span class="highlight">tremendous</span> impact on how we are viewed and how we view others. However, gaps in communication between people and genders still occur despite our best
              intentions and modern sensibilities.

              <span class="b u"><u>Jim (43) - Welsh – Designer: Describe typical male communication styles versus your own:</u><br /></span>
              I guess people would say that men aren’t good at
              <span class="highlight">emoting</span>. That we don’t talk about our feelings and we keep to ourselves. I can see why some would say that. I’m not much for idle chit-chat, but I wouldn’t
              say that I don’t express my feelings. It really depends on who I’m talking to and why.

            <div class="article">
              <span class="b u"><u>Mira (22) – Korean - Dancer: Describe typical female communication styles versus your own:</u><br /></span>
              I’d say that people expect women to be more talkative and personal. I agree - we communicate to build relationships. So, when I share my feelings, I want the other person to understand
              how I feel and form a deeper bond. I’m not always looking for answers. I think women
              <span class="highlight">intuitively</span> get that.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Although the way people communicate may be influenced by various factors, the simple desire to be understood is
              <span class="highlight">apparent</span> across all nationalities, cultures, and genders. That being said, the things we don’t say are often just as important as the things we do.
