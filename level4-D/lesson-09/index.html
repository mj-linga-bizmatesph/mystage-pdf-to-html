              When it comes to leadership, men and women have been known to take different approaches. Men tend to take a more aggressive, <span class="highlight">top-down</span> approach, whereas
              women are more likely to focus on relationship building. Whatever the situation, all good leaders must know how to inspire greatness.

              <span class="b u">Joanne (40) - Australian – School Principal: What is your approach to effective leadership?<br /></span>
              I lead first by listening. To me, effective leadership means making the best decisions given the circumstances. The only way to know what is happening is by
              <span class="highlight">getting the full picture</span> from the people around you. You have to trust them in order for them to trust you. Leadership is a team game.

              <span class="b u">Steven (51) – Dutch – Small Business Owner: What is your approach to effective leadership?:<br /></span>
              Leadership is about flexibility. Business is always <span class="highlight">morphing</span> and evolving. As a leader, you need to know when to change with the times. It’s about being
              someone that people want to follow. That means creating a culture where people feel challenged, motivated, and above all else – respected.

              Though there are many different schools of thought regarding effective leadership, gender is but a small <span class="highlight">cog</span> of a large, complex machine. In the end, the
              important thing to remember is that good leadership is less determined by gender as it is by expertise, communication, and vision.
