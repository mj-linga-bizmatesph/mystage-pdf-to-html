              Ark Manufacturing is located in the north end of the city. Recently, <span class="highlight">muggings</span>
              have become more and more of a problem in the area. Tim, the HR manager, wanting to ensure the safety of his staff, posts a memo asking all male staff to escort their female colleagues
              to their vehicles at night.
            </div>
            <div class="row">

                <p class="b name">Karen</p>
              </div>
              <div class="col">
                <p>
                  I understand where Tim is coming from – but I can’t help but feel a bit offended by the memo. I don’t need to be escorted to my car like a helpless child. I would much rather Tim
                  organize some self-defense classes or approach the problem differently instead of this <span class="highlight">antiquated</span> “guys should protect girls” nonsense.

              <div class="col">
                <p>
                  I’m not sure why Karen is <span class="highlight">giving me such a hard time</span> about this. This has nothing to do with gender equality or inequality. It’s about making sure my
                  staff get home safely. I appreciate Karen’s suggestion about the classes, but something needs to be done right away, and this is our best short-term solution.

            <div class="article">
              What started off as a safety problem suddenly became a battle about gender differences and equality. Although Tim and Karen are on the same side, their ideas about gender equality and
              approach to
              <span class="highlight">the problem put the two at odds</span> and complicated an already serious matter.
