            Chris, the president of a successful start-up just hired Emi, an executive assistant to <span

            his administrative tasks. Although things got off to a good start, Chris’ communication style became
            more and more difficult for Emi to understand, and soon began interfering with her duties.

                If I have to <span class="highlight">spell everything out</span> for her, she’s not doing her job.
                According to her
                resume, she’s got a lot of experience working for other executives so she should know
                what needs to be done. If I have to hold her hand and explain every little thing, I might
                as well just do it myself. I just want her to get things done, not chit-chat with me.

                Chris is really difficult to understand. I really don’t know what he wants. When I submit
                my work, he glances it over, gives it back to me, and tells me to redo it without any
                feedback. It’s like he expects me to read his mind. Maybe it’s a guy thing, but Chris
                needs to learn how to communicate what he wants more clearly and be more <span
                  class="highlight">personable</span>.

            As the situation continued to devolve, Emi began to wonder if she had made a mistake by agreeing to
            work for Chris. Even though she tried hard to understand him better and develop a closer relationship
            by engaging him in frequent small talk and conversation, Chris remained unreceptive. Emi is <span
