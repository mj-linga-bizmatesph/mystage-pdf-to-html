              Edward and Tammy have always been very passionate about their work. Tammy always expresses her
              feelings very openly whereas Edward has always been more inexpressive and stubborn. When Tammy
              and Edward found themselves on the same team, their wildly different personalities <span class="highlight">clashed</span>.

                  Tammy, you need to settle down and stop overreacting to everything I’m saying. All I
                  want to do is simply streamline our processes. You’re wasting so much of your time on
                  these meaningless tasks when you could be doing something useful. I’ve had years of
                  experience doing what I do, so it would be wise for you to <span class="highlight">heed</span> good advice.

              With Tammy and Edward constantly <span class="highlight">at each other’s throats</span>, it was hard for the team to get anything
              productive accomplished. Although their passion for their work was a positive, Tammy’s emotional
              outbursts and Edward’s cold approach to business and office relationships weren’t helping matters.
