            Erik and Liz have been going back and forth for hours trying to decide on whom to promote to
            department head. On one hand they had Hiro – a young, up-and-coming talent with great <span class="highlight">pedigree</span>
            and potential; on the other hand, they had Mai – a highly experienced woman in her early thirties.

                I like Mai; it’s just that she just got married and is planning on having children soon.
                Right now, we’re looking for someone who can make this post a priority. I don’t want to
                make this decision an issue about gender, but based on my experience, she’s not the
                right choice given her current circumstances. Hiro is the <span class="highlight">safe bet</span>.

                I had my son when I was in my early thirties and I’m still here and playing an important
                role in the company. It seems like you’re basing your decision on speculation. I’m not
                blaming you for having a male’s perspective, but I think you may be lacking <span class="highlight">credible</span>
                insight into the issue. As far as I’m concerned, Mai is the best and only choice.

            As the two continued to debate, it was clear that Erik and Liz would not see eye to eye. Erik’s values
            were <span class="highlight">rooted in</span> a more traditional corporate upbringing where men were seen as the driving force of
            the business. Liz, on the other hand, came from a new breed of women with more modern
            sensibilities.
