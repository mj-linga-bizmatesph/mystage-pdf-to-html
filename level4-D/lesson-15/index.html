              George had been working at a new but fairly traditional company for a few months but still hasn’t quite adjusted to the way certain office responsibilities were delegated to the women.
              In order to see if there was anything he could do, George asks Joe, his manager, for his <span class="highlight">two cents</span>.

                  I’m not sure I understand why the ladies - and only the ladies - in the office are cleaning the public spaces every morning. They even wipe my desk for me. Also, when someone buzzes
                  in on the intercom, all the ladies rush to answer the call while most of the men
                  <span class="highlight">lounge around</span> – even if they are closer. As a grown man, I feel a bit embarrassed by this.

                  It’s always been like that. They’re not asked to do it; it’s an unspoken duty they’ve taken on for themselves. If you feel guilty and want to take on some of these tasks, I’d say
                  don’t worry about it. It might <span class="highlight">perplex</span> some of the staff and our boss might not feel comfortable with you upending the office culture and the way
                  things are done.

              Although George understood the situation, he still couldn’t shake the feeling that as a man, he should be doing more <span class="highlight">to pull his weight</span>. He didn’t
              understand why this might confuse some of the staff and so decided to act on his beliefs, even if it meant going against Joe’s advice.
