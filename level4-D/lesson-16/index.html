            It was time for yearly performance evaluations at Vita, a medium-sized IT company. Sadly, the
            company had been facing some issues with the way the evaluations were being handled. Some of the
            men felt <span class="highlight">trepidation</span> giving direct feedback to women causing confusion and
            distrust among the staff.

                I’m always <span class="highlight">on edge</span> when I’m evaluating the women in the office. It’s not
                about
                communication issues, but some women have been coming down on us for discrimination
                and harassment. I’m trying to be fair, but if I’m too soft, I’m the bad guy; if I’m too hard,
                I’m the bad guy. I can’t help but feel some are using their gender as an advantage.

                This is unfair. No matter what we do, we always end up with <span class="highlight">the short end of the
                  stick</span>.
                If we’re too passive, we’re either ignored or brushed off. On the other hand, if we take a
                stronger stance and position, we’re suddenly seen as angry, unreasonable, and selfish
                feminists that “use our gender as an advantage”, even if that’s not our intention.

            Although the evaluations were designed to be as fair as possible, recent rise in complaints regarding
            unfair evaluations from women put a strain on the credibility of the system. If the situation continues
            unchecked, the gender dynamics among the staff could <span class="highlight">spell big trouble</span> for
            the company.
