              Tim has always been the office clown and loves to make everyone laugh. Although his humour has always been in good fun, sometimes his comments would
              <span class="highlight">rub people the wrong way</span> - especially the women in the office. Marcia, in particular, has just about reached her breaking point.

                  Why is everyone so serious all the time? Some might think my humor is a bit crude, but the way I see it, the best way to make a hard situation easier is to laugh at it. Men and women
                  have been misunderstanding each other for centuries. We’re not going to find the answer any time soon, so might as well have a bit of fun with it, right?

                  Tim wouldn’t be joking about it if he really understood how tough it is for people who are struggling with these issues. It’s only funny if you haven’t been personally affected by
                  the problem. Tim simply lacks the maturity, insight, and values to see that his jokes about women are in fact not funny at all – they’re really quite
                  <span class="highlight">off-putting</span>.

              Marcia had been
              <span class="highlight">putting up with Tim’s</span>
              insensitivity for as long as she could. But one day, when Tim casually joked about Marcia being unable to control her emotions due to her gender, she exploded in rage. Their working
              relationship dived and the office atmosphere has been tense ever since.
