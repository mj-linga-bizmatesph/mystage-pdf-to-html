              Ryan, the new member of the sales team at Horizon Tech, hasn’t been fitting in very well with the team. He is aggressive and refuses to take any advice. Diana, Ryan’s Mentor at Horizon
              Tech, is feeling frustrated. She talks with her two colleagues about the issue, hoping <span class="highlight">to offload some stress</span>.

                  I can totally understand how you feel. It must be really <span class="highlight">draining</span>, trying to build a close working relationship with someone like that. I wonder what
                  his goal is for joining the team if his attitude is like that! The last thing I’d want is to be stressed out by my colleagues when I go to the office everyday. Do you think things
                  are going to improve?

                  Well, you should tell him to get his act together and be a team player. I had a similar situation once where this one guy just wouldn’t cooperate. So, I sat him down and told him
                  very plainly and clearly that his attitude needed to improve, or else he’d risk losing the position. You should do the same. No use in
                  <span class="highlight">beating around the bush</span>.

              Although Diana appreciated Kaz’s input, she didn’t really feel better about things. Mana, on the other hand, had always been a great listener and seemed to really get where Diana was
              coming from. Diana knows what she needs to do but <span class="highlight">was torn about the approach</span> she wants to take.
