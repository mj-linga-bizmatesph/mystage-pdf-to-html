            Firefly, a small but growing software engineering company, has decided to invest a <span
              class="highlight">substantial</span>
            amount of money to make working at their company more appealing to applicants. Unsure about the
            best way to use the funds, management has asked the staff for their opinions.

                I say we use the money as a <span class="highlight">sign-on bonus</span>. Or, we could use it as an
                incentive to reward
                our best performers. Nothing is more attractive than a company that properly awards its
                best employees for their hard work. Aside from that, I guess we could use the money to
                buy better, more advanced laptops, computers, and gear.

                Our office has been needing a <span class="highlight">facelift</span> for some time. Especially the
                public spaces, like
                the cafeteria and the restrooms. We spend so much of our lives at work it’d be best to
                invest some of that money back into the office. I think it would really boost our
                company’s appeal and improve the morale of our existing staff

            Both suggestions were taken into account, but the management team was having a difficult time
            coming to a <span class="highlight">consensus</span>. More men tended to agree with Marcus’ proposal, while
            more women sided
            with Karla. Ultimately, the decision would come down to what the President thinks is best.
