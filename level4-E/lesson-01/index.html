            As we have explored so far in this level, culture can be partially identified by nation, company,
            occupation, and gender. However, in order to
            <span class="highlight">get the complete picture</span> of what it means to accurately define culture, one
            important piece of the puzzle still remains — generational culture.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            With the coming and going of each generation, environmental, <span class="highlight">socio-political</span>,
            and technological changes also occur; people born within a certain time period thus develop entirely unique
            sets of values, beliefs, ideologies, and social behaviors. These generational characteristics can be grouped
            into the four generations we will examine in this rank: baby boomer, Generation X, Millennial, and iGen
            generations.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            In the workplace, this <span class="highlight">mishmash</span> of generations can be a difficult environment
            to balance. Yet, by understanding this final piece of the cultural <span class="highlight">tapestry</span>,
            one can more effectively communicate, empathize, and collaborate with people across generations and reach a
            true understanding of culture.
