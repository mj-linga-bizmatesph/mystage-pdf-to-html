            As we have explored so far in this level, culture can be partially identified by nation, company, occupation, and gender. However, in order to 
            <span class="highlight">get the complete picture</span> of what it means to accurately define culture, one important piece of the puzzle still remains — generational culture.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            With the coming and going of each generation, environmental, <span class="highlight">socio-political</span>, and technological changes also occur; people born within a certain time period thus develop entirely unique sets of values, beliefs, ideologies, and social behaviors. These generational characteristics can be grouped into the four generations we will examine in this rank: baby boomer, Generation X, Millennial, and iGen generations.

          <div class="article">
            In the workplace, this <span class="highlight">mishmash</span> of generations can be a difficult environment to balance. Yet, by understanding this final piece of the cultural <span class="highlight">tapestry</span>, one can more effectively communicate, empathize, and collaborate with people across generations and reach a true understanding of culture.
