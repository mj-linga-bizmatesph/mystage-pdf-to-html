            The end of World War II saw a large rise in marriages, drops in average marriage age, and an increase in the
            number of births, resulting in a “baby boom” across
            <span class="highlight">industrialized</span> nations. This boosted the global economy and resulted in an
            era of prosperity, change, and the belief that anything was possible.

            Defined by strong work ethic, baby boomers are very committed to their careers and have worked hard for
            achievements and titles. As a result, they can be quite competitive and hierarchical. The booming economy
            also allowed for the pursuit of <span class="highlight">self-actualization</span> and expression unlike

            Experience will always be a valuable asset. And even though some baby boomers are starting to retire, those
            that are still in the workforce continue to be important contributors to the global economy, the development
