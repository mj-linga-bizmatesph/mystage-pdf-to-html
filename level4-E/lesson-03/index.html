              Also known as the “baby bust,” this generation’s birth rate was
              much lower than previous generations. In America, Gen X saw the
              rise of <span class="highlight">latchkey children</span>, high
              divorce rates, and a pop culture
              <span class="highlight">angst</span> that reflected an uncertain
              economy, dangerous diseases, and a lack of trust in the

              Gen Xers are a highly educated generation and are classified as
              being realistic, independent, and more socially progressive than
              their baby boomer parents. On the other hand, the challenges of
              growing up in an era of change and uncertainty left many Gen Xers
              hardened, skeptical, and <span class="highlight">cynical</span>.

              Personal Computer: By the mid-70s, microprocessors were becoming

              Gen X has seen its fair share of difficulties. The 1987 stock
              market crash and the Dot-Com bust in 2000 put many
              <span class="highlight">on the ropes</span> just as they were
              establishing their careers. However, despite these setbacks, Xers
              continue to be innovators, fighters, and a major driving force in
              the modern world.
