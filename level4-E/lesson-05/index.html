              The first generation to be fully raised on mobile technology, social media, and a progressive society comprised of mixed-race children and single-sex parents, the iGeneration believes
              that traditional choices don’t guarantee success and are out to
              <span class="highlight">make their own way</span>.

              Progressive and <span class="highlight">tech-innate</span>, iGeners are expected to be more entrepreneurial than previous generations. They seek fulfillment, excitement, and flexibility.
              However, they are more self-conscious, lack situational awareness, and have the shortest attention span of any generation.
