              Now that we have an understanding of the four main generations, let us examine the balance and distribution of these groups and how the global workforce is expected to change in the
              coming years.

            <div class="article">
              As of 2016, millennials have become the largest generational population in America. As a result, the last 50 years of boomer-defined workplace cultures are shifting rapidly to
              accommodate 21 <sup>st</sup> century values. By 2025, millennials are <span class="highlight">projected</span> to make up 75% of the entire American workforce, forcing many to re-examine
              their approach to business, leadership, and cross-generational collaboration.

              As boomers continue to retire from the workplace at a rate of nearly 10,000 per day,
              <span class="highlight">traditional notions</span>
              of rank and age are also shrinking. This leaves many Gen Xers in difficult positions: ones where age and experience no longer clearly define roles or command respect. According to
              research, nearly one in three report to someone younger, and one in seven report to bosses a full decade younger. This has made working with — or in some cases, under — millennials the
              biggest challenge for Gen Xers.

              Now, with iGeners entering the American workforce at a rate of 4.5 million per year, a
              <span class="highlight">paradigm shift</span> in workplace culture and cross-generational collaboration is upon the business world. Without a solid understanding of the generational
              landscape, conflict and instability are sure to <span class="highlight">run rampant</span>.
