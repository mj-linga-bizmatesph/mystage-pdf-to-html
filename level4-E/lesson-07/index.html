              With four different generations all <span class="highlight">vying for</span> rank, position, and fulfillment, conflicts are sure to arise. Among the numerous issues that occur, the following two lessons explore some of the most common.

            <div class="article">
              <p class="sub-text b u">TIME OWNERSHIP</p>
              Different generations define working hours differently. Some believe in clear distinctions between <span class="highlight">being on and off the clock</span>. Others believe in more flexible working schedules. By focusing on results as opposed to controls and processes, organizations may find that a bit of flexibility goes a long way. This may include options such as trial periods for remote work or unlimited vacation days.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              <p class="sub-text b u">LOYALTY</p>
              Older generations may have a company-first mentality and have difficulty understanding the seemingly <span class="highlight">fickle</span> nature of young people. Millennials thrive in purpose-driven environments and are only loyal to companies that enhance their skills and quality of life. By focusing on meaningful development, issues like short-job tenures, talent poachers, and generational rifts may be less problematic.

            <div class="article">
              Concepts of job fulfillment, ownership, and loyalty have changed and evolved significantly throughout the years. Traditional approaches to work, time management, and loyalty are no longer appealing to young talent and businesses all around the globe are <span class="highlight">scrambling</span> to make the necessary changes.
