              As we continue to highlight the challenges that occur when multiple generations <span class="highlight">inhabit</span> the same organization, it is important to remember that

              mentoring, everyone can get on the same page which allows for the pursuit of exciting new prospects while minimizing risk and discomfort for all involved.
