              The effects of generational conflict extend far beyond personal and emotional <span class="highlight">hardships</span>. The inability to effectively manage, collaborate, and deal with a multi-generational workplace results in significant damage to any company’s morale, effectiveness — and ultimately, its bottom line.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              The first casualty of any workplace conflict is often emotional. Unhappy employees eventually leave the company due to stress, which puts a strain on the organization and renders any training and time spent on professional development useless. Worse still are situations in which employees are forced to take paid leave due to mental <span class="highlight">distress</span>, further deepening irrecoverable costs. 
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              In other instances, marks of cross-generational conflict may reveal itself through the substandard quality of work, wasted time, and <span class="highlight">diminished</span> productivity. Miscommunication and the misalignment of goals and processes between generations results in lower quality output, an increase in dissatisfied customers, and a damaged brand that is struggling to find its identity.  
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              The full impact of generational conflict varies greatly from company to company and may be difficult to track; however, any loss of talent, opportunities, or resources should be taken seriously. Organizations that are able to effectively merge the experience of its baby boomers, the tenacity of its Gen Xers, and the dynamic energy of millennials and iGeners will surely find themselves in a much more <span class="highlight">advantageous</span> position than those that cannot.
