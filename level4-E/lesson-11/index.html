            <span class="highlight">Trouble was brewing</span> between Chris, an ambitious up-and-coming engineer, and
            Grant, his direct supervisor ten years his senior. Although Chris enjoyed his work and the company, working
            under Grant wasn’t easy. Grant had always seen Chris’ age as a weakness and wasn’t afraid to express his
            doubts.

              <p>
                I really don’t appreciate the way Grant keeps looking down on me. I’ve been <span
                  class="highlight">busting my chops</span> but haven’t been recognized at all for my efforts. I’m not
                sure how much more of this I want to take. I know I’ve only been here for little over a year, but I
                think it’s time I move on to something else. I don’t feel much purpose and Grant is so hard to deal
                with.

                I’ve been in this business for a long time even before Chris joined. It’s not that I don’t appreciate
                his talents or abilities, but he’s got to learn his place. Kids these days want to get ahead without
                first <span class="highlight">paying their dues</span>. Being successful requires more than just a fancy
                degree and upbringing. It takes determination. It’s a life lesson that Chris needs to learn.

            Before long, Chris submitted his resignation citing management as being the main reason for his
            dissatisfaction with his job. With young, skilled labour being more and more difficult to acquire, something
            must be done to ensure that young talent remains and turnover rates are <span class="highlight">kept in
