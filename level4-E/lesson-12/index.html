              Claire punches out at exactly 6PM everyday, regardless of how busy things are. She feels it is within her
              <span class="highlight">prerogative</span>, while some of her more senior colleagues find it slightly offensive and selfish of her. Claire has been feeling more and more pressure from
              her colleagues and a divide is starting to form.

                  The way I see it, Claire should feel a stronger sense of responsibility and pride towards her work. After all, this job is what puts food on the table for my family and has given me
                  the life I have. Our business has grown because of hard work and sacrifice. Now that business is <span class="highlight">sluggish</span>, we need to pull together and work even
                  harder as a team.

                  Why are all the seniors giving me those icy stares every time I leave the office? I’ve got a life outside of this office and I intend not to let my work interfere with that. It’s the
                  only way I keep
                  <span class="highlight">sane</span>. I’ve seen people devote their entire lives to their work only to wind up miserable. I’m not saying I don’t care about my work, I just know the
                  value of balance.

              Ben confronted Claire about her behaviour and the two got into a heated debate. Claire felt that Ben had overstepped his bounds and had no right to confront her about the way she managed
              her time. Ben on the other hand felt that her behaviour is damaging morale and <span class="highlight">hindering</span> the business.
