              Rain had been working at a medium-sized advertising company for nearly half a year. He was initially very excited about his new post, but he became quickly disillusioned by all the <span class="highlight">red tape</span>, lack of fresh ideas, and the management’s reluctance to hear him out on his ideas and proposals.

                  Why are all the managers in the company so slow or scared to adapt to new ideas? It’s so frustrating! I’ve been pushing for us to move on developing content on VR and AR platforms but people like Greg keep <span class="highlight">brushing me off</span>. We’ll never revolutionize the industry or be the next big thing if we’re always playing it safe.

                  I appreciate Rain’s passion, but now just isn’t the time. We’ve got a good way of doing things that <span class="highlight">yields results</span>, and Rain needs to learn how to walk before he runs.  I understand how exciting the technology is but we’ve <span class="highlight">been burned by tech booms</span> before. We’d better play it safe and make sure that we take calculated risks that make sense.

              Even though Greg agreed with some of Rain’s ideas and suggestions, he just wasn’t ready to put time and money into something he wasn’t familiar with. This led to Rain becoming more and more dissatisfied with his work, and Greg feeling more and more unsure about how best to lead his team.
