              As a way to further reduce costs and optimize operations, Mabel, the young head of customer support, proposed shifting the <span class="highlight">bulk of</span> the customer support team from office-based to an all-remote work scheme. Some welcomed the idea, while the older, more senior CS staff opposed the proposal.

                  Overhead costs are increasing by the year and it seems <span class="highlight">wildly unnecessary</span> for us to be spending money on large, expensive facilities to house our CS team. Modern technology allows our staff to do the work from home and I think it’s a win-win situation for everyone. We can keep management on-site, but everyone else can operate from home.

                  I come to work everyday not just because of the job but because of the relationships I have with my colleagues. Sure, e-mails, instant messages, and video conferences are efficient ways of communicating, but nothing beats good old face-to-face conversation. I don’t want to lose that <span class="highlight">solidarity</span> with everyone. I just don’t think I’ll be happy.

              Many of the senior employees and older CS managers had difficulty imagining the process and were uncomfortable communicating with their staff in a 
              <span class="highlight">solely</span> virtual work environment. Mabel really believed in the idea, but the lack of support meant that she would have to rethink her proposal.
