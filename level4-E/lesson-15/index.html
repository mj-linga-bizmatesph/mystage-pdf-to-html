              Ken‘s company has always been very traditional. It was important to know your position and everyone was careful not to step outside their bounds. However, with many of the
              <span class="highlight">old guard</span> retiring, more and more young people began entering the company — putting a strain on the culture.

                  I told my subordinate to do some research on a potential market and do you know what she said? She looked at me and said, “Why?”
                  <span class="highlight">Can you believe the nerve</span>? There is no why. Just do it. I don’t need to explain my reasoning. If you can’t follow simple orders without questioning
                  everything, you have no right to call yourself an employee.

                  I don’t get why Ken blew up like that! I only asked why because I wanted some background information. If Ken wants me to be at my best, I need to believe in my work. That means being
                  included in discussions and decision-making processes. This “know your place” <span class="highlight">nonsense</span> is getting in the way of our work and it’s making it very hard
                  for me to care.

              Ken would not budge. For the sake of efficiency, Ken believed that a clear top-down approach was the best way to get things done; hours spent
              <span class="highlight">deliberating</span> and explaining every detail was a waste of time. Mei, on the other hand, kept on insisting that she be more involved — leading to a breaking
              point.
