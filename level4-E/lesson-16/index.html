            Recently, things have been difficult for Harry, a project manager at an advertising firm. He usually enjoys his work, but now he often finds himself caught in the middle of the senior members of his team and the up-and-coming <span class="highlight">young guns</span> who are eager to shake things up and make an impression.

                My team is very diverse. I have a good mixture of ages and nationalities, but a lot of the younger guys just don’t know how to communicate with our senior members in a way that they understand. The same goes for the older staff too. In the end, it falls on me to <span class="highlight">mediate</span> for everyone and it’s starting to really slow things down and eat up my time.

                I’ve got a lot of good ideas that I want to move on, but every time we sit down at meetings, it’s as if some of the older guys simply don’t understand the words coming out of my mouth. They either brush me off, tell me it’s too risky, <span class="highlight">unfeasible</span>, or just not the right timing. Why are they so resistant? It’s like, dude… come on! Really?

            Harry’s experience and age put him right in the middle of a growing divide. He’s old enough to relate to his senior staff and young enough to understand where some of the
            <span class="highlight">new blood</span> is coming from. Unfortunately, being the only person in the position has given him a lot of difficulty unifying his team.
