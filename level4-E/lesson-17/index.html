              Kei had been wanting to establish his own company for years. He had never felt comfortable working for others and dreamed of doing something big, important, and meaningful with his life. Before quitting his job, Kei decided to ask his co-workers for their <span class="highlight">two cents</span>.

                  Go for it! What have you got to lose? When I was growing up, everyone dreamt of starting their own businesses. Now, people seem to be happy working for someone else. If you’ve got that entrepreneurial spirit, I suggest you put it to good use. Anything is possible if you are willing to put in the hard work. There might be <span class="highlight">rough patches</span> but the sky’s the limit.

                  To be honest, I’m not sure it’s such a good idea. It seems like you’re really <span class="highlight">gung ho</span> about it, but you can never really be sure about what will happen. The global economy is due for another crash and I’ve been through it once before. You’d better be sure about what you’re getting yourself into. If I were you, I’d focus on what I have.

              Kei appreciated everyone’s <span class="highlight">candid</span> opinions but couldn’t commit to leaving his job just yet. He needed to make a decision soon though, because the longer he waited, the harder it would be for him to move forward. On one hand, he was inspired by Frank’s advice; on the other, Rob had given him a lot to think about.
