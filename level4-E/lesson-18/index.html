              Andy, “The Gatekeeper”, has always been the <span class="highlight">pragmatic</span> realist of the company. He was surrounded by dreamers, wishful thinkers, and idealists. However, when
              it came to realizing those dreams, it always came down to Andy to put together a realistic plan and ensure the real work gets done.

                  I might seem like a hard person to deal with, but people in my position are the ones that need to do the heavy lifting — and frankly, have the most to lose. The other generations
                  think I’m <span class="highlight">crabby</span> and lack vision, but nothing could be further from the truth. It’s just that when it comes down to it, I’m the one that’s going to be
                  accountable.

                  There are the thinkers and then there are the doers. Andy is the latter. I wish he had more <span class="highlight">spunk</span> and innovation. A lot of the youngsters have some
                  great ideas, but from what I hear, it’s been hard for them to work under Andy who takes a straight edge approach to everything. Andy needs to be more flexible, open-minded, and
                  creative.

              Andy started feeling more and more pressure. His seniors demanded results and innovation while his juniors questioned his every move. Although their
              <span class="highlight">idealism</span> was commendable, it did little more than add an extra layer of complication to an already seemingly thankless middle-manager position.
