              Liana grew up around social media and was accustomed to posting her life online. This was part of her daily routine and no one had ever expressed any concerns about it before. One day, after posting a comment about “slaving away for an unethical, life-draining corporate <span class="highlight">stooge</span>”, she was pulled aside.

                  I know that social media is a big part of life these days, but your recent post has <span class="highlight">crossed the line</span>. Please keep those kinds of personal comments to yourself and off social media. We don’t appreciate those kind of insults directed towards management and we demand that you remove your post or risk facing potentially severe consequences.

                  This issue is bigger than what I wrote in my post; it’s about my right as an individual to express my thoughts. If Peter wanted me to take it down, maybe he should’ve asked what was <span class="highlight">bugging</span> me and what the company could do to fix it. Ordering me to delete it or risk being punished is everything that’s wrong with the corporate world today.

              Liana’s frustration at how the situation was being handled doubled her <span class="highlight">resolve</span>. Peter, on the other hand, was caught in an incredibly tough situation. He understood the concept of free speech, but it was also his job to protect the company’s interests and to make sure Liana acts appropriately.
