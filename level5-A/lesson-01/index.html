              Your beliefs become your thoughts. Your thoughts become your
              words. Your words become your actions. Your actions become your
              habits. Your habits become your values. Your values become your
              destiny.

              If you’ve worked in the same organization for quite some time, you
              probably already know your company’s core values like the back of
              your hand. These core values have influenced your organization’s
              internal processes, its vision, and its culture. You might have
              realized by now how some of your values, if not all, perfectly
              align with your company’s. But, have you ever stopped to think
              what YOUR core values are as an individual?
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Our core values aren’t purely inherent in nature but are mostly
              shaped and influenced by different morals and principles around
              us. There are values that define our character (e.g. integrity,
              ambition, etc.). There are values that dictate how we want to live
              our lives (e.g. to be free, to be happy, etc.). And, there are
              values we share with other people (e.g. religion, political views,
              etc.).
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Whatever they are, these fundamental beliefs deeply impact our
              behavior, decisions, or actions, which in turn can make or break
              anything we do. This rank aims to present different core values
              from various businesspeople and how these values have greatly
              influenced their business success.
