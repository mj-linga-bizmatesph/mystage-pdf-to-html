              JCPenney is one of the biggest and most successful department
              store chains in the US with over 1000 stores. However, not many
              people know that it was originally named the Golden Rule Store –
              named after the golden rule: treat others the way you'd like
              to be treated. James Cash Penney's parents taught him to
              always follow the golden rule, which eventually became the
              foundation of his business ethics.

            <div class="article">
              This was what Mr. Penney had to say about choosing the name,
              “Golden Rule” for his store: &quot;In setting up a business under
              the name and meaning of Golden Rule, I was publicly binding
              myself, in my business relations, to a principle which had been a
              real intimate part of my family upbringing. To me the sign on the
              store was much more than a trade name… Our idea was to make money
              and build business through serving the community with fair dealing
              and honest value ...&quot;
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              It was in 1913 that the name was changed to what we know now as
              J.C. Penney Company, Inc. Nonetheless, the company still continues
              to uphold the principle on which it was established: treating
              others with respect and fairness. No wonder it has survived its
              share of ups and downs and even the Great Depression in the 1930s.
              JCPenney has now become a household name and a favorite in the US
              where you can get great value for your money.
