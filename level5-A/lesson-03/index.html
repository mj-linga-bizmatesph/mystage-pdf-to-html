              The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through
              sharing information.

              Today’s generation is fortunate being just a click away from information. Back in the 80s, hours and hours
              had to be spent in libraries just to get research done. But all that changed for the better when someone
              took the time to find the most efficient way of organizing information that everyone could have access to
              without virtually having to shell out a dime. Enter Timothy Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide
              Web.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Timothy Berners-Lee received low-key publicity even after his World Wide Web creation became a necessity.
              Not too many people knew the man behind the creation of the Web. Had he patented his invention, his WWW
              information-sharing initiative would have made him filthy rich. Can you imagine how much he could be
              earning every millisecond if he were to charge everyone who used his invention? We won’t even dare count!
              But Tim wasn’t after the money nor the fame.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Tim believes that information should be free. Earning from his invention would only contradict his
              ideologies. Besides, he’s a man of simple pleasures. Changing how the world procures information is more
              than enough of a reward for Tim whose crusade is to get everyone informed regardless of social standing,
              gender and race. Tim understood the value of information as a global currency and thus opened a whole new
              opportunity where people can communicate and collaborate freely.
