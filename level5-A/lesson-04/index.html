              The business of business should not be about money. It should be
              about responsibility. It should be about public good, not private
              greed.

              The late Anita Roddick founded The Body Shop in her humble
              kitchen. Having no budget for fancy packaging, she used recycled
              bottles and labeled her products manually. There was no question
              about Anita’s love for The Body Shop, which she built with her
              bare hands — literally and figuratively. Apart from being an
              entrepreneur, Anita was also a staunch supporter of the
              environment and animals, and this is what The Body Shop has been
              known for.

            <div class="article">
              L’Oréal had been open about its interest in Anita’s eco-friendly
              store. So it came as a shock to everyone when news about L’Oréal
              acquiring The Body Shop came about. Being an advocate of animal
              rights, Anita was the last person you’d expect to sell her company
              to L’Oreal – a company that had been known for their use of
              animals for product development. It just didn’t make any sense,
              but there was something about The Body Shop that L’Oreal wanted to
              embrace.

            <div class="article">
              Anita’s company was driven by ethics rather than profit. It never
              occurred to her that these principles would resonate with L’Oreal
              and influence the way they would do business. She sold her company
              for 625 million pounds and gave her millions to charity, leaving
              her daughters with no inheritance. In hindsight, we must give
              credit to Anita for taking herself out of the equation just to see
              her business make a bigger impact.
