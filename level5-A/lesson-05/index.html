              All human beings are born entrepreneurs. Some get a chance to
              unleash that capacity. Some never got the chance, never knew that
              he or she has that capacity.

              Having lived in Bangladesh, Dr. Muhammad Yunus witnessed the
              plight of families living below the poverty line. Armed with the
              understanding of economic principles, he saw how capitalist banks
              had preyed upon these families which made the situation worse. He
              could’ve just ignored it and focused on getting rich himself, but
              Muhammad Yunus, unlike other people, opted to take the road less
              traveled — to help alleviate the lives of poverty-stricken
              families in his home country.

              Out of desperation to augment their family income, Bangladeshi
              women find themselves buried in debt because of ridiculously high
              interest rates. Muhammad went around the neighborhood and was
              shocked to find out that the total debt they had to settle was
              merely 27 dollars. So, from his own pocket, he settled their
              accounts. However, he knew that paying their debt was just the tip
              of the iceberg. He had to get into the root of the
              problem—poverty.

              He started out by convincing the banks to approve women’s loans
              using his name as guarantor. Surprisingly, Bangladeshi women
              turned out to be good borrowers. This inspired him to establish
              the Grameen Bank, an institution which grants loans to women who
              wish to engage in business. In a culture where the empowering of
              women is unheard of, Muhammad was labeled a heretic. But he
              doesn’t mind. He has better things to do other than to make his
              public image look good.
