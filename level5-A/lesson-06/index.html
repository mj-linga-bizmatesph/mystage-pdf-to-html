              I have been impressed with the urgency of doing. Knowing is not
              enough; we must apply. Being willing is not enough; we must do.

              Renaissance, a period in history that gave rise to the rebirth of
              art, science, religion, humanism and self-awareness. This period
              marked the dawn of man’s quest for knowledge and gave birth to
              polymaths, men whose expertise spanned a wide range of fields. But
              out of all the famous masters of this era, no other figure had
              made such an impact as Leonardo da Vinci – a man whose genius and
              influence still echoes until today.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Leonardo da Vinci was one of the greatest polymaths to have ever
              lived. He is primarily known as the great artist who painted the
              Mona Lisa, but it wasn’t the Arts alone that caught his interest.
              Leonardo was described as a man with “unquenchable curiosity” –
              the kind of curiosity that laid out the blueprints of modern
              knowledge. He carefully presented his observations in detail with
              his drawings, possibly as reference for future generations – all
              13,000 pages of them.

            <div class="article">
              His achievements paved the way for modern art, engineering and
              anatomy. He may not have been a business tycoon but he was
              definitely a visionary; a quality that successful business leaders
              share. His success can be measured not by his net worth, but by
              the amount of contributions that man is currently benefitting from
              today. His quest for knowledge has encouraged us to open our eyes
              and further explore the world around us. This is his legacy and
              this might have been his vision.
