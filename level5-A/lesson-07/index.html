              Great artists don’t paint from other people’s descriptions or even
              from photographs; they like to see the subject for themselves. The
              same is true for great strategists.

              Perhaps the world’s most versatile fruit is the tomato. And yes,
              it is a fruit. It was first introduced in Europe during the 16th
              century by Spanish colonizers who first discovered it when they
              came to South and Central America. They brought them back and
              planted them; not for consumption, but to adorn their gardens
              because they first thought it was poisonous. When the world found
              out that the tomato was also edible, and not just a beautiful
              garden ornament, Japan did not leave itself behind.

              In 1899, a Japanese entrepreneur first cultivated and introduced
              the “edible” tomato in Japan and discovered its versatility and
              nutritional value in the culinary field. He was a pioneer in the
              industry. He took the risk of avoiding existing markets and
              creating demand in a new one – the Blue Ocean Strategy. He later
              formed Kagome Co., Ltd. and became the first producer of tomato
              products in Japan.

            <div class="article">
              Through constant research, development and innovation, Kagome has
              produced an array of tomato products. The company has expanded its
              business to different countries in Asia, America and Europe. In a
              world of artificial and synthetic goods, Kagome is living the
              company’s mission to bring all-natural fruit and vegetable
              products closer to consumers. Thanks to one man’s vision, Japan
              and the rest of the world now taste the “fruits” of his labor. His
              name is Ichitaro Kanie.
