              The greatness of a man is not in how much wealth he acquires, but
              in his integrity and his ability to affect those around him
              positively.

              Music. The language of the soul. No other medium could perhaps
              communicate emotions and ideas better than a well-written
              melodious song. We often remember a musical piece through its
              melody, but we seldom stop to think to really digest the meaning
              behind it. There are many musicians who can create wonderful
              melodies, but only a few can back it up with impactful lyrics. Bob
              Marley was one of these music geniuses.

              Reggae – although not the most popular of melodies out there – is
              something that Bob Marley was good at. He used this music style to
              communicate his ideology for peace and unity. Not only did he
              vividly paint the struggles of his fellow Jamaicans living an
              oppressed and impoverished life, he also captured the spiritual
              fervor that remained their source of strength. He made the world
              aware of the plight of his country and boldly penned his emotions
              towards love, faith, peace and revolution.

              Bob Marley was a man whose songwriting could be so controversial
              that a group of men tried to kill him days before a concert.
              However, his audacity inspired others to openly express their
              feelings in hopes of bringing about change around them according
              to their own ideals through non-violent means. It is through this
              legacy of Bob Marley that we are able to listen to music that
              comments on the wrongs and injustices around us and how the world
              could be improved through the eyes of a musician.
