              Many leaders of big organizations, I think, don&#039;t believe
              that change is possible. But if you look at history, things do
              change, and if your business is static, you&#039;re likely to have
              issues.

              When Google was founded back in 1998, their mission was to
              “organize the world’s information and make it universally
              accessible and useful”. Indeed they have achieved this mission
              while serving a legion of users and customers around the globe.
              But their mission alone cannot take credit for where they are now.
              Google’s philosophy and cultural values also come into play. But
              one philosophy stands out from the rest – “Great just isn’t good
              enough.”

            <div class="article">
              Larry Page and Sergey Brin first named their search engine Backrub
              in 1997. They decided to change it and after some brainstorming,
              they came up with the name Google; a misspelling of the word
              googol, the numeral 1 followed by a hundred zeroes, a fitting
              concept for a company whose objective is to organize huge amounts
              of information. Fast forward years later, it is pretty obvious
              that Google has achieved its goal and completed their mission.

              At this stage, some companies would simply call it a day and just
              go with the flow of success. But not Google. Great just isn’t good
              enough. A company needs to improve and innovate in order to thrive
              in an ever-changing world. Times change, people’s needs change and
              even the ways we access information change, therefore their
              products and processes need to change in order to keep up. This
              simple philosophy made Google one of the most globally successful
              companies.
