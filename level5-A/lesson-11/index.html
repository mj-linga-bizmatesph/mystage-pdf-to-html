              I strongly believe that those of us, who are privileged to have wealth, should contribute significantly to
              try and create a better world for the millions who are far less privileged.

              Dubbed as the “Bill Gates of Asia,” Azim Premji has undoubtedly exceeded his late father’s expectations.
              From a medium-sized peanut oil company, he turned their family business into a billion-dollar
              technological mammoth. He’s now touted as one of the richest men in the world. According to Forbes, Azim’s
              personal wealth is, at the very least, worth 12 billion dollars. But even so, Azim doesn’t feel the need
              nor desire to live a life of extreme luxury and decadence.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Despite being ranked as the 41st wealthiest man in the world, Azim has no problems driving an average car.
              That’s quite a feat for someone who could buy the most expensive luxury car in cold cash. And it doesn’t
              stop there. Azim travels in economy class when he could afford to buy a private jet for himself. One more
              thing—it’s highly unlikely for you to bump into Azim in five-star hotels. Whenever Azim goes on a business
              trip, he spends the night in decent three-star hotels.

            <div class="article">
              Apart from industry and profit, Bill Gates and Azim Premji have one more thing in common—both delight in
              giving. In fact, Azim is the first Indian billionaire to heed Bill and Melinda Gates’ call for the richest
              people in the world to participate in the Giving Pledge initiative. Azim has good reasons for living a
              life far simpler than what he could actually afford. Instead of basking in luxury, Azim prefers to give
              billions away to charity.
