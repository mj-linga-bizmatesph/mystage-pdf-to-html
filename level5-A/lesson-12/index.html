              Management that is destructively critical when mistakes are made
              kills initiative. And it's essential that we have many people
              with initiative if we are to continue to grow.

              3M is the simple name behind some of the most famous brands in the
              world – Scotch tape, Scotch Brite, and Post-it Notes. 3M employees
              often say that you’re never three meters away from a 3M product –
              a believable claim given the sheer amount of market segments that
              they encompass. In order to have that many products, they needed
              to get innovation down to a fine art and become a company that
              never stops inventing.

            <div class="article">
              After a century of innovation though, one would think that 3M
              scientists and engineers would eventually run out of ideas. So the
              company came up with the 15% Time Program, operating on the core
              belief that creativity needs freedom. 3M employees were given 15%
              of their working time to pursue their own projects and follow
              their insights. 3M believes that the secret ingredient to its
              success is that they gave their talented people time and resources
              to prove their worth.

              At 3M, mistakes are encouraged, even embraced. Take the Post-it
              Notes for example. It was a failed glue project because the
              adhesive made was too weak for its purpose, but it was never
              discarded. Four years later, they reused the failed project to
              coat pieces of paper as bookmarks. This trivial incident led to
              the production of the Post-it Notes. Since then, 3M went on to
              create a culture of innovation that has been the hallmark of 3M’s
              growth.
