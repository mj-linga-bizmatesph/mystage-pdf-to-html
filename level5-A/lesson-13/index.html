              Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the
              present without compromising the ability of future generations to
              meet their own needs.

              Gro Harlem Brundtland coined sustainable development. That,
              however, is not the sole reason why her name is revered in the
              higher echelons of global governance. Gro became the first female
              Prime Minister of Norway and once directed the World Health
              Organization, the medical arm of the United Nations. Gro is a wife
              to a career-oriented gentleman and a loving mother who went as far
              as bringing her children to school while she was studying to be a
              doctor.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Dr. Brundtland is the quintessential example of how a woman should
              be in this age: confident and self-sufficient. Responsibilities
              outside the home do not faze her. Ask this decorated politician
              and diplomat whether or not she’s done enough, she’ll probably
              enumerate countless things she’s still out to accomplish. One of
              them is to educate first-world countries of their responsibility
              to take into consideration the carbon footprint they leave behind
              as their economy and industries grow.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Now in her 70s, Gro still finds enough motivation to keep toiling
              even though the future doesn’t hold that much promise. She’s
              raised her children, given them her all and she couldn’t just let
              her children’s children live in a hardly habitable Earth. Her
              vision, backed by strong maternal instincts, has probably earned
              her a spot as one of the greatest female political leaders and one
              of the most dedicated advocates of public health.

            Think of someone who is a parent and a leader at the same time. Name
            one quality that you think makes him/her a master of leadership and
            parenthood.
