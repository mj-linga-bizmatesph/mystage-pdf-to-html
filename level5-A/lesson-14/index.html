              Understanding the customer, feeling what they are feeling, seeing
              what competitors are doing, you end up having a richer sense of
              the marketplace.

              For more than a century, General Electric Company (GE) has
              continuously provided its customers with premium quality products
              and services. In fact, this manufacturing company is known as one
              of the most innovative and dynamic in the world. The company is
              also known for supporting its products with unique marketing
              campaigns and advertising strategies. Indeed, the company’s
              success may be attributed to its core value of “staying close with
              customers’ needs”.

              Establishing a closer relationship with customers is key in order
              to flourish in the competitive business scene. It may seem easy to
              say, but it takes careful deliberation and intensive study to know
              what your customers want and need. GE took a major leap when it
              planned to penetrate the Asian market, an area where many other
              Western companies failed. Market research in demographics,
              competition and culture were given importance.

            <div class="article">
              In the end, GE’s release of white-goods, which were then ‘foreign’
              to the Asian market, proved to be successful. In this globally
              competitive society, it’s not so much about the survival of the
              fittest, but it’s more about who can read the market, adapt and
              innovate quickly. Customers have become much wiser when making
              purchases. So, in order to endure the test of time, GE believes
              wholeheartedly that a successful business stays close with
              customers and listens to what they want.
