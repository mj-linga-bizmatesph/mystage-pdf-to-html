              Leonardo Sarao was the man who revolutionized the Philippine mass
              transportation industry. He modified the surplus war jeeps that
              Americans left after the Second World War into a new means of
              transportation. What started out as a garage project soon became a
              small automotive business in 1953. Eventually, these
              brightly-colored refashioned vehicles would go on to become a
              national icon affectionately known as: the jeepney.

              After the Second World War more and more entrepreneurs began
              converting American surplus war jeeps into jeepneys.
              Unfortunately, many were considered too ineffective and dangerous
              for public use. But seeing huge potential in this endeavor, Sarao
              got a small loan and began applying his talents to create a safer,
              more efficient, and economical prototype. Eventually, Sarao’s hard
              work paid off and his jeepneys soon became the most popular mode
              of transportation in Manila.

              From the ashes of war, Leonardo Sarao used his creativity and
              resourcefulness to address issues that his country was facing at
              the time. His jeepneys helped kickstart the rehabilitation of the
              capital by mass-transporting people, goods and building materials
              as well as providing a source of income to families affected by
              the war. His values gave birth to a concept so iconic, that it
              would forever be recognized as uniquely Filipino by the rest of
              the world.
