              Sacrificing one’s life for a fellow human being is utterly
              remarkable. But what do you make of someone who is ready to put
              his/her life on the line to save a far less animated living thing?
              Trees, for instance. Vandana Shiva of India saved trees by hugging
              them. She was a part of the so-called tree hugging movement when
              she was only a teenager. Having a farmer for a mother profoundly
              influenced Vandana’s take on things.

            <div class="article">
              Vandana became a physicist. She obtained her doctorate certificate
              from the University of Western Ontario, Canada. But she went to
              school not only for her own sake. Vandana had an underlying
              agenda— she wanted to learn everything about chemical technology
              so she could become the voice of underrepresented farmers. With
              that in mind and equipped with knowledge and experience, she
              established the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and
              Ecology in 1982.

              In case you haven’t noticed, fast-food restaurants are not as
              common in India as in other Asian countries. Any idea why? If
              you’re guessing Vandana has anything to do with it, you’re right.
              As a physicist, she knew how food additives could harm the body.
              Vandana may be old now, but she’s far from wobbly in her cause.
              She’ll remain standing firm on her beliefs like the trees she
              hugged way back when she was younger for as long as she has life
              left in her.
