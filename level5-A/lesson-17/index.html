              The idea of low-cost traveling in Asia was unheard of around 20
              years ago. Now, the average person can simply fly around Asia
              almost anytime. In 2001, the airline industry changed forever
              thanks to a childhood dream. Tony Fernandes, the boy who once
              dreamt of starting his own airline company realized his dream and
              now has around a hundred planes in his fleet. He bought AirAsia, a
              once debt-stricken company, and turned the business around by
              pioneering low-cost air travel in Asia.

            <div class="article">
              AirAsia would have never taken off with excellent marketing alone.
              The company mostly owes its success to Tony’s hands-on management
              approach or MBWA (Management By Walking Around). He walks around
              and gets his hands dirty – from checking in on his cabin crew to
              assisting his ground crew load luggage onto the plane. Where most
              people of the same position shun manual labor, Tony embraced it
              willingly in order to see what works well and what doesn’t.

              Tony believes that he is bound to make big mistakes if he were
              just to sit in his office and look at financial reports. He needs
              to know exactly what is going on and he does this so well. Still,
              his purpose behind it isn’t just to improve efficiency but to
              break down the wall that divides employers and employees. By
              working with people and experiencing their jobs firsthand, Tony
              was able to understand his employees’ wants, needs, and feelings.
