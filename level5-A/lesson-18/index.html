              What happens if you fund everyone's idea, sight unseen,
              inside a large company — which, as far as we were able to
              determine, has never happened before?

              Man’s creativity is only limited by the current reality he is
              living in. The technology, the funds, the society, etc. can
              potentially stunt the growth of our most innovative ideas. But
              what if your own company would willingly fund your concepts and
              help you realize them, would you grab the opportunity? Adobe
              Incorporated did just that. The software company took one of their
              core values to the next level. Enter the “Kickbox” program.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              The Kickbox is just a box of goodies… with a thousand dollar
              prepaid card inside. Anyone in the company can request for it, no
              questions asked. The idea behind the program is to encourage
              employees to turn their business ideas into reality. It doesn’t
              matter who you are, what your position is, or which department you
              belong to. If you have a great idea that you think would
              contribute to Adobe’s success, grab a Kickbox and start cracking.

              Other companies might view this as something new and innovative,
              while others might see it as something controversial and absurd.
              Whatever the case, Adobe found a way to foster man’s creativity
              even further. This core value has manifested itself in their
              products for many years, and this has encouraged graphic artists,
              programmers, and editors to push their limits. From their staff to
              their customers, Adobe has the word “creativity” flowing through
              its veins.
