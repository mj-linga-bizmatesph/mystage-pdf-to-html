              Empty your mind, be formless, shapeless — like water. Now you put
              water in a cup, it becomes the cup; You put water into a bottle it
              becomes the bottle; You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot.
              Now water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.

              Dragons in the Asian culture are revered mythical creatures that
              symbolize power, nobility and benevolence. In pop culture, no
              other man has earned the title quite like Bruce Lee. Most people
              remember him for his martial arts prowess, but only a few people
              know that there’s something more profound behind that one-inch
              punch. More than just a fighter, Bruce Lee was also a philosopher
              whose words of wisdom still echo today.

              Among his many quotes, there is one that really stands out – “be
              water, my friend”. The analogy was so simple and yet so deep that
              even businesspeople incorporated the philosophy into their lives.
              Being like water means becoming fearless, to boldly explore and
              seep through tight situations, and becoming flexible, to be able
              to think, react, and adapt quickly. However, the most insightful
              aspect of being like water is that you have the power to soothe or
              destroy.

              Most of us cripple ourselves with anxiety or bind ourselves with
              rules and situations without realizing that there’s something we
              can do too. We can either choose to become rigid and continue to
              be a square peg in a round hole, or become fluid and just go with
              the flow. We can either choose to stagnate or break through the
              walls that confine us. Be like water; understand its ways and
              become the best person you are meant to be.
