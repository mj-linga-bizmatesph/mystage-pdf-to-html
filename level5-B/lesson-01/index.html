            It's really easy to have a nice philosophy about openness, but moving the world in that direction is a
            different thing. It requires both understanding where you want to go and being pragmatic about getting
            there.

            Having a solid mission and vision is essential to any organization. It’s the guiding light that steers the
            company to its intended direction. The idea is simple: vision is the destination, while mission is the
            manner of reaching it. However, having a crystal clear goal won’t cut it in most cases, especially in
            business. It needs to be coupled with a good strategy in order to fully realize success, and this is where
            pragmatism comes into play.

            But what does it mean to be pragmatic? In its simplest definition, it just means being practical, realistic,
            or sensible – something that most successful businesspeople have in common. Pragmatic individuals approach
            things realistically and execute their plans based on what is practical. But, it doesn’t stop there. No
            matter how flawless their plans are, pragmatists would find ways to improve them.

          <div class="article">
            In this rank, we will journey through success stories where pragmatists go out of their way to improve a
            flaw – big or small – in their business. Their pragmatic ways in improving quality, efficiency and business
            processes have catapulted their companies at the height of business success.
