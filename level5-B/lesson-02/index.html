            Starbucks is not an advertiser; people think we are a great marketing company, but in fact we spend very
            little money on marketing and more money on training our people than advertising.

            One of the world’s most ubiquitous and most consumed beverages is none other than coffee. And when it comes
            to coffee, the first brand that comes to mind for many people is Starbucks. But, not everyone knows the man
            behind its success. His name was Alfred Peet. Although Peet was not the founder of the famous coffeehouse
            chain, his efforts catapulted the founders of Starbucks to global fame and success.

          <div class="article">
            Peet worked for a coffee and tea company in New Zealand before he immigrated to California in 1955. He was
            dismayed with the poor quality of coffee in the US so he introduced his style of roasting beans – a
            knowledge he acquired from working in the coffee industry in Europe. He pioneered the specialty coffee and
            passed on this knowledge and experience to Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker, the founders of the
            world-famous Starbucks Corporation.

          <div class="article">
            Armed with the knowledge they learned, the trio established their own company in 1971 as a local coffee bean
            roaster and retailer. Since then, the company has expanded rapidly and opened over 20,000 stores in 62
            countries across the globe. Most coffee drinkers around the world owe their love of the drink to the men,
            who made an effort to boost quality through knowledge and experience. Without them, our fondness for coffee
            may not have been the same.
