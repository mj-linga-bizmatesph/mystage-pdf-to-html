              Back in the late 70’s, if you walked into any large enterprise,
              you would probably come across the colossal mainframe computers
              that powered the company’s database. Only a handful of programming
              wizards knew how to use them – and that was just to manage data
              input and output. Then came Lawrence Ellison, a university dropout
              who worked as a programmer in California for eight years. Together
              with his former boss, he set up what would later become Oracle
              Systems Corporation.

            <div class="article">
              Their company was off to a rough start but stumbled upon an IBM
              research paper describing a new programming language called SQL.
              Unlike his competitors, Ellison seized the opportunity and rewrote
              the language so it could be run on any computer. From then on,
              Oracle’s business skyrocketed. But for all of Ellison’s
              ferociousness, Oracle began to make promises it could not keep.
              Many times, Oracle falsely claimed compatibility with several
              platforms and hardware.

              After some reflection, Ellison realized that it was his mess to
              clean. Oracle needed to start over. He created a new management
              team and fired everyone else. They liquidated accounts and
              tightened financial control. A new system was put into place that
              rewarded sales reps only when a product was shipped. Oracle then
              became the gold standard for database technology and applications
              for enterprises worldwide – serving the largest multinational
              company to the smallest coffee shop.
