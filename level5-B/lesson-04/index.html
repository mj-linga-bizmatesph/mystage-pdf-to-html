          <div class="article">
            The wheel is arguably one of man’s greatest inventions. We’ve come a long way from using crude wooden
            rollers and spoked metal wheels. While the earliest wheels were effective in getting us from point A to
            point B, they offered little to no comfort during travel and easily broke. One day, a Scottish veterinarian
            by the name of John Boyd Dunlop, found the solution that would change the world of travel forever:
            inflatable rubber tires.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            Dunlop’s profession required him to do a lot of traveling and his travelling along cobbled streets was
            always bumpy and uncomfortable. However, it was his instincts as a parent that ultimately led to the
            invention. Although fitted with rubber, Dunlop noticed how his son was having a hard and uncomfortable time
            riding his tricycle. So, he stitched strips of rubber together to make a tube, wrapped it with another layer
            of rubber, filled it with air and slapped it on his son’s tricycle wheels.
          </div>
          <div class="article">
            Dunlop’s solution to a trivial problem turned out to be a multi million-dollar product that served as a
            template for tire manufacturers. From everyday transportation to motorsports, the pneumatic tire has proven
            to be indispensable. Who would have thought a humble veterinarian could come up with such a brilliant idea
            that would forever change the way we travel? It only goes to show that anyone, regardless of his/her
            background or profession, can make an impact and leave a lasting legacy.
