              My innovation involved taking an idea from the telecommunications
              and banking industries, and applying that idea to the
              transportation business.

              Courier services have become an integral part of businesses today.
              The idea of having an express delivery system decades ago was
              unheard of, but such was the vision of a university student
              Frederick W. Smith who came up with the idea to set up a reliable
              overnight courier service as an assignment for his university
              class. Sadly, his professor thought the idea wasn’t feasible and
              ended up giving him a grade of C for effort. But, that didn’t stop
              the young Fred Smith.

            <div class="article">
              After college, Smith enlisted for the Marine Corps and
              deliberately studied military procurement and delivery procedures.
              He fused military efficiency with methods taken from the banking
              and telecommunications industries, and started his own company –
              FedEx. Smith set up a hub network similar to bank clearing houses
              and developed an airfreight system that could accommodate
              time-sensitive shipments such as medicines, electronics and relief
              goods.

            <div class="article">
              Today, FedEx is the world’s leading express delivery provider,
              delivering 7.5 million packages every day to over 200 countries.
              Just imagine the world without FedEx. How could medicines,
              computer parts, European fragrances, Hawaiian flowers and vital
              documents reach us? His professor might not have foreseen this
              need, but today’s businesses depend on courier services such as
              FedEx – an idea pioneered by an undergraduate student more than 40
              years ago.
