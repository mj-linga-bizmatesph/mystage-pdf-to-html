              Our approach was very simple. It was about creating a universal
              language. A show that will be attractive toward every people
              coming from all over the world. And that was a big thing.

              Fire-eating, accordion-playing and stilt-walking: these are not
              the usual skills and job experience you’d expect to find in a
              CEO’s resume but Guy Laliberté, CEO of one of Canada’s largest
              cultural exports, Cirque du Soleil, did all of these and more.
              Once a street performer, he won a grant from the Quebec government
              to put on a unique show to celebrate the 450th anniversary of
              Canada’s discovery. Since then, Laliberté has brought Cirque to a
              global scale.

               Cirque du Soleil’s success, however, happened at a time when the
              circus business had been in a long-term decline. Other forms of
              entertainment and an increase in animal rights awareness made the
              circus business a hard sell. However, Laliberté’s strategy was not
              to compete within the current circus industry but to create its
              own space. While the traditional circus catered to children,
              Cirque pulled in a new group of consumers – adults and corporate
              clients who were fans of opera and ballet.

            <div class="article">
              This new audience was willing to spend, as long as they were
              treated to a unique experience. Cirque owes its success to Guy
              Laliberté’s strategic thinking. He knew the current situation of
              the industry – declining audience share and big competitors – and
              decided that rather than trying his luck against these odds, he
              would make his own. Through this strategy, he was able to create
              his own audience and bring Cirque du Soleil to the triumph and
              adoration that it enjoys today.
