              Many creative people are finding that creativity doesn't grow
              in abundance, it grows from scarcity - the more Lego bricks you
              have doesn't mean you're going to be more creative; you
              can be very creative with very few Lego bricks.

              When Ole Kirk Christiansen founded Lego in 1932, the toy company
              had been on a winning streak until 1998. For more than sixty
              unbelievable years, Lego had never been in the red. However, the
              arrival of video games put an end to that streak, and in just five
              years, Lego found itself struggling to stay afloat. The company
              took to diversifying their products – from opening theme parks to
              creating a video game company – only to lose more money.

              Amazingly, Lego made a huge turnaround under Jørgen Vig
              Knudstorp’s leadership. Just like the toys that the company
              manufactures, the former CEO took it apart and rebuilt it brick by
              brick. He ditched the deadweight Legoland parks and halved the
              production of Lego bricks. But the most notable step Knudstorp
              took was promoting interaction with Lego fans – something his
              predecessors disliked - further breaking the mold and improving
              Lego’s brand in the eyes of a new generation.

              From hot new toys to a blockbuster movie franchise, Lego has once
              again become a global hit across various generations. Had
              Knudstorp not made such bold moves to revitalize the business,
              Lego would have most likely faded into obscurity. Sometimes, when
              things don’t go as planned, we just have to repeat the process of
              taking the pieces apart, evaluating the situation, and putting it
              together again until everything works perfectly – just like a
              child creating a Lego masterpiece.

            Think of a process, policy or framework in your company that needs
            to be changed. How would you break it down and rebuild it to make it
            more effective and modern?
