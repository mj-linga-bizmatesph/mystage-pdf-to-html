              My theory was that good furniture could be priced so that the man
              with the flat wallet would be attracted to it, would make a place
              for it in his spending, and could afford it.

              Desks, tables, chairs, shelves… these are the common furniture you
              see at home and in offices. Some are simple, while some are
              painstakingly adorned with intricate designs. There’s no doubt
              that these wooden wonders enhance a room’s elegance and ambiance,
              but they can also be very expensive or sometimes hard to find at a
              fair price. This had been the norm, until Ikea stepped in and the
              company began to revolutionize the furniture industry.

            <div class="article">
              Ingvar Kamprad, the founder of Ikea, knew what made furniture
              expensive – customers also pay for the costs of labor and
              shipping. Kamprad’s solution: get rid of these costs. So, instead
              of paying workers to render hours in assembling furniture, they
              let the customers do it on their own. If the furniture is bought
              unassembled, then it could fit nicely inside a typical family car.
              This practical and ingenious approach, plus a customer-first
              attitude, made Ikea the world’s largest furniture retailer.

              The company continuously strives to incorporate modern and
              eco-friendly interior designs on their products while being
              sensitive to customers’ needs. In 1990, the company took proactive
              measures to deal with environmental issues such as using only
              recyclable materials for their flat packaging and using wood from
              responsibly managed forests. Like any other business, Ikea still
              has its eyes on further expansion. More importantly, Ikea has a
              heart for the environment and the people around it.
