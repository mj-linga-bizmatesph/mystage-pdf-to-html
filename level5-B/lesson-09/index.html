              ‘Lamborghini, you may be able to drive a tractor but you will
              never be able to handle a Ferrari properly.’ This was the point
              when I finally decided to make a perfect car.

              When it comes to world-class, luxury sports car manufacturers,
              Italy’s own Lamborghini is certainly at the top of the list.
              However, Lamborghini didn’t start as the automotive giant we know
              today. Founder Ferruccio Lamborghini was interested in mechanics
              and cars at an early age and honed his skills to become an
              entrepreneur. After the Second World War, Ferruccio started a
              small business that produced tractors to aid farmers like his
              father.

            <div class="article">
              Over time, Lamborghini was finally able to pursue his passion for
              fast cars. Among his collection was a Ferrari. After encountering
              a problem with his Ferrari’s clutch, he discovered that the car
              used nearly the same clutch mechanism as his tractors. He
              confronted Enzo Ferrari, the founder himself, but his complaints
              and suggestions were simply brushed off. The meeting left him both
              angered and inspired which eventually led to Ferruccio developing
              a better clutch mechanism as a way of mocking Ferrari.

            <div class="article">
              Ferruccio’s success shifted his company from making tractors to
              manufacturing high quality sports cars that rivaled Ferrari – the
              company he once admired. He chose a raging bull to symbolize his
              company, a fitting icon that embodies his roots as a farmer and
              his emotions as a dissatisfied customer. Today, his company
              produces one of the world’s most luxurious, and sought-after
              sports cars. And it was all because he just wanted a resolution to
              a simple problem.
