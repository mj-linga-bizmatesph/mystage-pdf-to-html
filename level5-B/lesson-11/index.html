            John Pierpont Morgan was one of the most powerful men during his time. He was a leader in the finance
            industry and the founding father of the banking titan, JPMorgan Chase. During the 19th century, back when
            America was in the process of building its economic foundations, JP Morgan was one step ahead of the fierce
            competition for power. JP Morgan continued his father’s legacy and etched his name in the banking industry.

            Using his vast wealth and bold business approach, he cleverly took his competitors out of the picture by
            buying out majority of their shares. He started out with small, troubled companies and gradually made his
            way towards owning large corporations. He streamlined his company by monopolizing the railroad, steel,
            electricity and banking industries, thus ensuring a more stable and profitable business. This system was
            called “Morganization”.

            JP Morgan was indeed the most influential man in his age. So influential that he helped save America from
            plunging down in to economic crisis. He did this by loaning the federal government millions of dollars as he
            led the country’s top financiers in bailing out struggling financial institutions in order to stabilize
            markets. Despite his initiative to avert the economic crisis, many rejected and criticized him for fear that
            his immense power could manipulate the financial system for his own gain.
