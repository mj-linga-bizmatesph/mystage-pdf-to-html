              The biggest mistake young designers make is that they try to make
              their advertising look like advertising.

              In the 90’s, the California Milk Processing Board (CMPB) was
              concerned with the long-term decline of milk sales. People knew
              its nutritional value but sales volume kept falling anyway. Jeff
              Manning and Jeff Goodby found the answer. They realized that milk
              was up against a variety of sodas and fruit juices that came in
              all kinds of colors and flavors and all sizes of packaging;
              whereas milk was white, it came in gallons, and in a plain carton.
              In short, milk was just plain boring.

              Enter the ‘Got Milk?’ campaign. It had a simple but powerful
              message to combat milk’s weakness – yes milk wasn’t exciting, but
              what would you do without it? Breakfast wouldn’t be the same
              without milk; without milk, what would you drink to wash down
              cookies, cakes and peanut butter sandwiches? The first ads that
              rolled out showed unexpected, funny situations of people running
              out of milk and the desperation it caused. The ads were so
              creative that ‘Got Milk?’ earned its place in popular culture.

              Soon, the entire United States’ milk industry wanted to jump on
              the ‘Got Milk?’ bandwagon. In 1997, the iconic milk mustache
              campaign had celebrities across the nation volunteering to be part
              of the movement sporting milk mustaches on billboards, magazines
              and other print ads. From celebrities and athletes to even
              fictional icons like Batman and Superman, they all became part of
              the campaign. Manning and Goodby figured out milk’s weakness and
              used it to come up with a very creative ad.
