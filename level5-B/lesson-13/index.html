              Meiji Era, Japan. A young man named Sakichi Toyoda had an
              epiphany. He was described as a man with “a strong ambition to
              contribute to society.” He realized that Western civilization was
              based on machinery – an inevitable progress that would take hold
              of the rest of the world soon. Having a great interest in
              machinery himself, Toyoda turned his attention towards improving
              the efficiency of the handloom, a machine used by local farm
              families to weave fabric.

            <div class="article">
              Through trial and error and studying how machines work, Toyoda
              patented his first invention: a wooden handloom that only required
              one hand to operate instead of two. It was more efficient but it
              was still manually operated. Toyoda then set his sights toward
              developing the power loom, but there was a problem – he needed
              funds to further his invention. Toyoda’s solution: start a small
              factory and invent more ground-breaking machines.

            <div class="article">
              After four successful years in the industry, Toyoda finally had
              the funds to develop his power loom. The new machine was so
              efficient that it greatly increased the fabric’s quality and the
              factory’s productivity. Over the years, Toyoda’s company became
              globally successful. It all began with a strong need to contribute
              to his society and was backed up by an unrelenting quest for
              perfection. We now know his company as Toyota Industries
              Corporation.
