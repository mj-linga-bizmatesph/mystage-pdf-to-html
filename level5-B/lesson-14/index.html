              Real cultural diversity results from the interchange of ideas,
              products, and influences, not from the insular development of a
              single national style.

              Henry Ford, the man behind one of America’s automotive giants,
              made the automobile available to the middle class. When he
              introduced his first mass-produced car, the Model T, he invested
              in excessive publicity. He wanted to make sure that every
              newspaper advertised his inexpensive 4-wheeled innovation. The
              venture paid off and, in a short span of time, the production and
              sales of the Model T went through the roof. But Ford also had his
              share of bad decisions.

               Ford wanted to expand his business on a global scale. He
              established “Fordlandia”, a huge factory in the Amazon that would
              manufacture rubber tires for his cars. Sadly, things didn’t go as
              planned. He crossed the line when the local workers were forced to
              live the “American way” and were forbidden to consume tobacco and
              alcohol even in their own homes. The workers soon revolted and
              refused to work, and Ford ended up shutting down the rubber
              plantation without profit.

              It’s safe to assume that Henry Ford learned from this costly
              mistake, otherwise his company would have been forever relegated
              to the bottom of automotive history. Had he not forced his own
              culture on the locals in Brazil, Fordlandia might have been a huge
              success as well. It just goes to show that when companies decide
              to expand globally, business leaders should take cultural
              diversity into account. This is one lesson that multinational
              companies could learn from.

            Imagine you are asked to manage a new office overseas. What would
            you do to learn the local culture in order to make the business
            succeed?
