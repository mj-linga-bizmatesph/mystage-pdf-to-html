              Anybody who succeeds is helping people. The secret to success is
              find a need and fill it; find a hurt and heal it; find a problem
              and solve it.

              When Thomas Edison lit the first electric light bulb in 1880, the
              way we illuminate our homes was forever changed. It would have
              been the perfect artificial light source, but it had one problem:
              poor energy efficiency. It consumes more energy and burns out
              quickly. In the 1960s, LEDs made a promising debut. It has better
              energy efficiency, but there’s an immediate problem: Only red and
              green were available at the time. An even bigger problem is you
              also need blue to produce white.

            <div class="article">
              In the science of optics, white light is produced by combining
              red, green and blue lights. The first two colors have been around
              for many years, but the blue LED remained elusive until 3 Japanese
              scientists made a breakthrough. Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano
              made some developments in producing blue LEDs, but it was Shuji
              Nakamura who perfected the technique, which made its production
              cheaper. This breakthrough finally led to the invention of the
              bright white LEDs.

              These 3 Japanese scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in
              physics for their invention. Their efforts contributed to solving
              a much larger problem. Because of them, we now have
              energy-efficient lamps that illuminate almost every establishment
              – lights that consume less energy, shine brighter and last a lot
              longer. Our ideas, no matter how small or trivial, could possibly
              solve an immediate problem, which could ultimately solve an even
              bigger problem.
