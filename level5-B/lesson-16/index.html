              Since the 1980s, the world has witnessed the evolution of the
              Windows operating system. From the old DOS-based environment to
              the tiled apps interface, Windows has gone through a lot of
              changes. Oddly enough, Microsoft seemed to have skipped a version
              – Windows 8 was followed by Windows 10. Accident? Poor counting
              skills? Hardly. Microsoft claims they jumped to Windows 10 because
              it’s 2 versions better than its predecessor and may very well be
              the final version Microsoft will ever release.

              Many tech-savvy enthusiasts believe that Windows 10 was launched
              prematurely. They are correct as the first Windows 10 version was
              ugly, unstable and bug-infested. Apparently there was a method to
              this madness. Microsoft intended to launch Windows 10 while still
              in development. To rack up revenues from sales? Not exactly. In
              fact, one could upgrade to Windows 10 for free back then. The
              company did this because it finally learned how to listen to its
              customers.

              Microsoft wanted Windows 10 to be the perfect operating system,
              both for PC and mobile devices. The company realized that the best
              person who could truly say this was its user – not the programmer.
              Unlike before, Windows’ users are now part of the OS development
              process. The marketing strategy worked as planned. Windows 10
              released updates regularly based on feedback from its customers
              and certainly improved since its first iteration.
