            <div class="article"> The household names Huggies and Kleenex are just two of Kimberly-Clark’s famous brand names. Known as one of the biggest producers of paper-based consumer products, the company has certainly come a long way since its founding in 1872. Its first business was operating paper mills and it grew this business steadily in the next century. By 1971, however, Kimberly-Clark was an old, run-of-the-mill paper company. Over the last 20 years, its stocks had fallen by 36% behind the general market. 
            </div> 
            <div class="article"> Enter Darwin Smith, the CEO that made “one of the gutsiest moves” in corporate history. He realized that Kimberly-Clark was doomed to mediocrity because the bulk of its capital was in their century-old core business – the coated paper mills. Instead of coming up with visionary statements or engineering takeovers, Smith simply asked his team ,“What can we become the best at?” They concluded that their only shot at becoming the best was to carve their own niche. 
            </div> 
            <div class="article"> “Smith strategy”: refocus their business and sell the old mills. The proceeds were used to compete with paper-product giants like Procter &amp; Gamble. Many years later, Kimberly-Clark emerged as the leading paper-based consumer products company in the world. The company even outperformed some of the biggest names such as Coca-Cola, Hewlett-Packard, 3M and General Electric. To this day, Darwin Smith is still revered as one of the best examples of twentieth-century leadership.
