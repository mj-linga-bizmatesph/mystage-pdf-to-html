              Whatever achievements and successes I've had didn't
              happen overnight. It is all a product of guidance, hard work,
              careful planning, and intense, passionate execution over many
              years.

              He never thought of becoming the youngest Filipino billionaire.
              Edgar “Injap” Sia is the young entrepreneur who commercialized a
              traditional Filipino dish – the Chicken Inasal. He capitalized on
              the two things that the locals are fond of: chicken barbecue and
              rice – lots and lots of rice. Sia immediately saw the business
              potential behind it and started his business with a 250 square
              meter restaurant.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Sia’s business gained nationwide success and is now known as Mang
              Inasal (Mr. Barbecue). What made his business model so successful
              is that his fast food restaurant chain serves traditional Filipino
              comfort dishes and unlimited rice – an idea taken from unlimited
              calls and text messages in the telecommunications industry in the
              Philippines. Pretty soon, Mang Inasal caught the attention of
              Jollibee Foods Corp., the country’s leading fast food chain. Sia
              sold his company for 3 billion PHP.

            <div class="article">
              However, Sia’s success story didn’t stop there. He noticed that
              most third class cities in the country have big schools, big
              hospitals, big ports, etc. but never a shopping mall – something
              that Filipinos are also very fond of. This is his next business
              venture and with years ahead of him, Sia could write more chapters
              in his success story. It seems being on the lookout for
              opportunities to grow and try something new could pay off, even if
              you decide to drop out of college.

            Think of anything traditional that’s native to your country (dish,
            item, clothes, etc.) that might become a global success. How would
            you market this business idea?
