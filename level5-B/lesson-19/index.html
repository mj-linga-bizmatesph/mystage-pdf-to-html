              According to the old adage, “knowing the enemy is half the battle
              won”. The best embodiment of this saying can be read from the
              book, The Art of War by a Chinese general named Sun Tzu who lived
              sometime around 500 BC. He laid out 13 chapters showing the
              science behind winning and losing. According to his book, factors
              such as planning, leadership, management, execution and effective
              use of resources all come into play.

              In summary, the Art of War is all about coming up with a good
              strategy. From laying plans and timing the execution to studying
              the landscape and being flexible with one’s strategies, Sun Tzu
              wrote a treasure trove of wisdom for winning. At its core, the Art
              of War is all about knowing who you are and your competitors. By
              fully understanding the strengths and weaknesses of all the
              players in the industry, business leaders can devise a great
              strategy and execute it perfectly.

              Although Sun Tzu’s teachings were written down thousands of years
              ago, the basic principles are still applicable today. Armed forces
              from different civilizations have learned from it, so it’s not
              surprising that these ideologies can also be applied in business.
              Although it may be incomparable to the horrors of actual warfare,
              the philosophies behind the book when applied to business can be a
              decisive factor in drawing the line between success and failure.
