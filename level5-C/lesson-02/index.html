              There’s nobody in the Philippines who doesn’t know SM. It’s been a
              household name for decades. Older generations still fondly call it
              “Shoe mart” because that’s how the multi-billion dollar shopping
              mall chain started – a modest shoe store. Henry Sy, Sr., the
              founder, came from humble beginnings in a small village in South
              China. When he was 12, he immigrated to Manila with his father who
              ran two small retail stores.

            <div class="article">
              Towards the end of the Second World War, his father’s business was
              reduced to rubble. Henry’s father went back to China, but he chose
              to stay and eventually ventured into the business of buying and
              selling. His merchandise of choice: shoes. During that time, when
              all the men of his age were pursuing higher education, Henry did
              things differently. He went to the US to gather business ideas
              that would later pave the way for modern shopping malls.

              Henry tirelessly learned from his customers, suppliers and
              employees. And, with this hands-on attitude, he was able to
              discover the needs of the people around him. His wise use of time
              and money slowly paid off over the years. He created a business
              empire that spans industries such as retail, banking, real estate,
              mining, hospitality, education and healthcare services. There’s a
              lot to learn from the man’s story, but there’s more to learn from
              his passion for success.
