              Ralph Lauren has been greatly associated with menswear. Over the
              years, he expanded his empire to include furniture, perfumes, and
              accessories. But who would have thought that such an influential
              person would have such humble beginnings? While others considered
              rags as trash, Ralph Lauren found good use for them. Art coupled
              with focused determination towards perfection gave birth to the
              first Ralph Lauren tie collection.

              He was told, “The world is not yet ready for Ralph Lauren.”
              Instead of feeling sorry for himself, he did all he could to prove
              them wrong. He went from one place to another, selling his ties to
              different department stores and it didn&#039;t take long before
              they got sold out. When Ralph Lauren had enough capital for decent
              fabric, he started launching his male and female fashion lines.
              Again, they sold like pancakes to the public and after a few
              years, he had an entire building for his creation.

              The once anonymous name of Ralph Lauren became a legend. He
              continued to innovate as he went beyond clothing and ventured into
              home collection and fragrances. But despite his level of
              achievement, he never compromised quality. After all, he has quite
              a reputation to sustain. Not one Ralph Lauren creation is launched
              without the Ralph Lauren personally checking the quality himself.
              Indeed, the world is not ready for Ralph Lauren—to stop.
