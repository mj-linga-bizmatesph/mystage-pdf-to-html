              As the former US President Bill Clinton went through a scandal
              that shook the entire country and his marriage, he called Anthony
              “Tony” Robbins to help him weigh his options and redirect his
              life. His wife, Mrs. Hillary Clinton, who never left him despite
              the controversy, was a major support system for him, but Tony
              Robbins&#039; presence made a huge difference as well. After all,
              Tony Robbins is one of the world’s most dynamic life coaches.

              Bold and charismatic, Tony created an empire out of inspiring
              people towards success. His great desire to help others achieve
              their true potential came from his personal experience with family
              troubles and depression. He grew up being poor and had a mother
              who never supported his interests. On one occasion, while the
              family had nothing to eat, a man knocked on their door and brought
              them food. That moment had a positive impact on Tony and he vowed
              that he would help people someday.

            <div class="article">
              After being chased out of the house, Tony never went back home.
              Instead, he turned his life around with his burning desire to make
              a difference and did what he does best—motivating people. He
              learned from the best motivational speakers, and is now the most
              famous and well-respected performance coach in the world. Tony
              Robbins&#039; life is a testimony of conquering fears—something he
              himself declares everybody is capable of doing.
