              Audrey Hepburn, who was famous for her beauty and grace was
              greatly known for her iconic roles. Her style was regarded as a
              classic over the years, and although many sought to mimic her
              elegance, she remained in a league of her own. She had roles in
              both Broadway and film, but perhaps she is most fondly remembered
              as Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany&#039;s and as runaway
              Princess Anne in Roman Holiday. Her fans adored her as she
              continued to shine in the &#039;50s and &#039;60s.

              Audrey&#039;s father was a Nazi sympathizer and when her parents
              separated, she fled with her mother to Holland where she continued
              to study dancing. The following year, the Germans invaded and she
              witnessed the abuse and executions of the Jews. Audrey became a
              messenger for rebel groups and danced ballet in secret shows to
              raise money for the resistance against the Germans. Since food was
              scarce, she had to eat tulips, which resulted to her having severe
              health problems.

              Holland was later liberated, but her malnutrition made her unable
              to do ballet, so she shifted to acting. After many auditions and
              minor roles, she was able to perform as a lead actress and her
              acting skills coupled with her beauty made the world fall in love
              with her. Audrey was one of the few actors who won a Tony, an Emmy
              and an Oscar. She later became a UN Ambassador to help war victims
              around the world. Audrey Hepburn was an epitome of being beautiful
              inside and out.
