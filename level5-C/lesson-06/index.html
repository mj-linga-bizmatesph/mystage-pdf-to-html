              Being a single parent can be very difficult. Being a single parent and being homeless at the same time is
              a totally different story. The challenges one might face in this situation could break anyone, but that
              did not stop Chris Gardner from pursuing happiness and his dream of being a good breadwinner for his son.
              With no college degree or corporate connections, he made his way up the ladder of success through hard
              work, perseverance, and true passion.

              Chris worked as a medical supply salesman in San Francisco, but the pay was not enough to support his
              family. Eventually, his wife left them and Chris had to fend for his son. Life got so difficult that they
              slept in parks, shelters, and even on the floor of a train station bathroom. Things began to change when
              he had a chance encounter with a red Ferrari. Chris asked the owner – a stockbroker – what he did for a
              living, and soon, he found himself doing an internship program as a broker.

            <div class="article">
              His small stipend still was not enough, but Chris endured all of this because he believed things would
              change. After work, he would mow lawns and clean basements for additional income. Chris was finally
              rewarded when he was offered a full-time job at his firm, where he excelled as a broker. As time passed,
              Chris left his job and became a successful founder of a brokerage firm, Gardner Rich & Co. Chris Gardner
              indeed pursued his happiness as he claimed ownership of his dreams.
