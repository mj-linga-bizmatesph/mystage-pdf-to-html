              Born with a silver spoon in her mouth, Cher Wang was meant to be
              an entrepreneur. Her father, the late Y.C. Wang, was a legendary
              tycoon who wanted his children to experience many different
              things, so Cher was sent to study in the US. After high school,
              she pursued music at Berkeley, but she found her true calling in
              economics. She switched courses, and after finishing her degree,
              she followed her passion and sold computers at First International
              Computer.

            <div class="article">
              Later on, as Cher envisioned creating a device that could act as a
              computer, phone, and calculator, but things did not go smoothly as
              planned as she started her company. HTC began launching laptops,
              but it failed in the industry. The company redirected itself and
              became a contract manufacturer of PDAs and mobile phones. During
              this time, Cher designed computer chips in her living room, spent
              nights at work, and even encouraged her R&amp;D staff to work late
              in the office.

            <div class="article">
              Then, the long nights finally paid off. The company had a big
              break when HTC won its first major project to design and produce
              Compaq Aero PDA in 2000. Since then, HTC continued to rise to the
              top ranks and this led to Cher being named as one of the most
              powerful women by Forbes Magazine. Still to this day, “ the pride
              of Taiwan” continues to lead one of the largest mobile phone
              makers in the market.

            of weeks in order to meet a tight deadline. How would you
            communicate this to your team?
