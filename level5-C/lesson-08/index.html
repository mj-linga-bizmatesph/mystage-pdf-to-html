              It was after the Second World War and the auto industry suffered
              greatly along with many others in Japan, but Soichiro Honda took
              this as an opportunity to establish a technical research facility
              in Hamamatsu, Japan in 1946. Two years later, Honda Motor Company,
              Ltd was born and later branched out to Los Angeles California and
              eventually became one of the top ten largest automobile
              manufacturers around the globe.

              Honda created an indispensable and efficient mode of
              transportation: the motorized bicycle; and this innovation made
              the company the world's largest motorbike maker during the
              1970's. Pushing his limits, he further developed his 2-stroke
              engine to venture into car manufacturing. His first models
              didn't do so well in the American market, but it all changed
              when he manufactured fuel-efficient engines with lower emissions.
              This led to the creation of the first Honda Civic.

              In spite of his success, Honda did not stop pursuing his passion.
              He continued to advance in the industry by competing with luxury
              car makers in the US and Europe thus, he also manufactured a
              luxury line, introduced under the name Acura. Honda became the
              very first Japanese car maker to get it this far. Presently, Honda
              continues to embody the heart and passion of Soichiro—tirelessly
              innovating and improving their cars to shape the auto industry in
              Japan and the world.
