              Farrokh Bulsara, who later changed his name to Freddie Mercury, was born in 1946 in Zanzibar Tanzania. He
              grew up shy and highly conscious of his two front teeth and prominent overbite. He was often teased and he
              found himself covering his mouth while he smiled. But, this imperfection became one of his numerous
              trademarks later on in his life. As his family settled in London, Freddie enrolled in the Ealing College
              of Art to reinvent himself.

              Desperate for success in the music industry, Freddie joined many bands, but none were what he envisioned.
              He worked as a baggage handler in Heathrow Airport and sold second-hand clothes for money. Finally, his
              dream started being realized when he met three other bandmates and formed Queen. In 1974, they released
              their first hit, “Killer Queen” which became popular in both the UK and the US. Formerly shy, Freddie
              became an absolutely unique and charismatic performer on stage.

              The energy and vocal range showed by Freddie while singing enticed music fans. Queen continued to astound
              with songs such as “Bohemian Rhapsody,” a 7-minute rock operetta, “We Will Rock You,” “We are the
              Champions,” and “Another One Bites The Dust.” As live performers, the band was amazing, but their most
              memorable act was the 1985 Live Aid charity concert where Freddie moved the crowd to perform along with
              them. True to his dream, his name remains a legend till today.
