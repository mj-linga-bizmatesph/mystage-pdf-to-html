              You are the change that you dream and I am the change that I
              dream. And collectively we are the change that this world needs to
              be.

              Not all heroes wear capes. In fact, some of them bring around a
              “kariton” or a makeshift pushcart to teach kids on the streets
              basic reading and writing. Efren Peñaflorida started the Dynamic
              Teen Company to lure kids away from vices and pique their interest
              in social work. A brilliant student himself, he was able to study
              through scholarship grants, but continued reaching out to the poor
              with books, pens, tables, and chairs, and teaching in unusual
              locations like cemeteries and trash dumps.

              Growing up in the slums, Efren was surrounded by bullies and
              gangs. They were either beating him up or recruiting him to join
              them, but instead of feeling down, he sought alternative
              activities to help those who were prone to juvenile delinquency.
              When Efren turned 16, he started his advocacy of bringing around
              his “pushcart classroom.” As he worked, he and his friends
              encountered a lot of difficulties but his mentor continued to
              encourage them, thus pushing them forward.

              Later on, Efren's work was filmed and he gained publicity for
              what he did. In 2009, he won CNN Hero of the Year and continued
              receiving other awards such as the Order of the Lakandula by then
              Philippine president, Gloria Arroyo, Bayaning Pilipino (Philippine
              Hero) by Gawad Geny Lopez and being featured in many youth
              organizations. Efren was grateful for the honor, but he believed
              that what he did was not extraordinary, but simply a crucial step
              to making his dream of change a reality.

            Think of a system, tradition, or custom that you feel needs to
            change. What small things can you do to make others realize that
            it’s time for a change.
