              Champions aren’t made in gyms. Champions are made from something
              they have deep inside them—a desire, a dream, a vision. They have
              to have last-minute stamina, they have to be a little faster, they
              have to have the skill and the will. But the will must be stronger
              than the skill.

              Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr. or more popularly known as Muhammad
              Ali, grew up in a time of racial discrimination. Some suggest that
              this made him passionate for boxing. With extraordinary talent and
              commitment, he began training when he was 12. He had his first
              amateur bout and win in 1954. In 1960, he became famous for
              winning an Olympic Gold Medal and more so in 1964, when he knocked
              out unbeatable Sonny Liston, becoming the heavyweight champion at
              the age of 22.

              Despite all of this, Muhammad Ali was stripped of all his titles
              and was forced into a hiatus in 1967 after he refused to be
              drafted into the Vietnam War, but he had a passionate comeback in
              1970, when he fought in what was called the “Fight of the Century”
              against Joe Frazier, who gave Ali his first defeat as a pro. But,
              true to his calling as a champion, he beat Frazier six months
              later and continued to dominate the boxing world as he persevered
              and punched his way to victories.

              Muhammad Ali called himsef “The Greatest.” His conquests came from
              intense training and dedication. He was the first to come into the
              gym and the last to leave. At first, he ran from his apartment
              because he didn't have money for transportation. He
              didn't settle for mediocrity; he knew he was meant to be a
              champ. Ali believed that “Impossible is not a fact. It’s an
              opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It’s a dare. Impossible
              is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing.”
