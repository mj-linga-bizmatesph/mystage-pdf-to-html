              Hayao Miyazaki, world acclaimed animator and master story teller,
              has made a name for himself with his trademark style in art and in
              his depiction of life lessons in his films. As a man of unique
              style, he uses unconventional ways to produce his work—he creates
              the characters and story line as he goes along with the creation
              process. One recurring theme in his films is the conflict between
              progress of the world and the order of things in nature.

            <div class="article">
              Born to a family with an aeronautics business, Hayao learned to
              love flying. They moved to Utsunomiya City, where he became more
              attached to nature and forests. His fascination with
              children&#039;s stories was seen when he joined the
              children&#039;s literature society while studying, and when he
              pursued animation despite studying economics. He joined Toei
              Animation and quickly climbed the ranks as he displayed his
              creative side through innovative ideas and leading projects in the
              studio.

            <div class="article">
              Later, Hayao, together with Isao Takahata, launched Studio Ghibli,
              and gave the world classics such as Princess Mononoke, Spirited
              Away, and My Neighbor Totoro to name a few. Studio Ghibli used the
              traditional method of animation: most of the frames were hand
              drawn before being put together into fluid movement. While the
              rest of the world was quick to adapt to the use of CGI, Hayao only
              allowed minor CGI additions to his work. His story and his process
              made Miyazaki&#039;s work praise-worthy.
