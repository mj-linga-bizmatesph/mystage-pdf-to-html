              The burden of poverty and this bitter taste of helplessness and isolation sort of branded on my heart
              forever the questions that still drive me.

              Mainly known as a real estate developer and once the richest man in Asia, Li Ka-Shing is a powerful figure
              in the business world. His companies control 70% of Hong Kong's port traffic and most of the
              telecommunications and utilities. But Li did not become a magnate through comfort and ease. Rather, he
              tirelessly worked from the ground up at the age of 12 after quitting school, since his father died of
              tuberculosis when their family fled from Guangdong to Hong Kong to escape war.

            <div class="article">
              Li found a job as an apprentice in a watch-strap factory, where he worked 16 hours a day, 7 days a week
              and he would send 90% of his pay to his mother. Soon, he became a salesman, and then the general manager
              of the factory when he was just 19. Due to his appetite for learning, he taught himself business and
              skills through reading books. He even completed his company's accounting books by himself in the first
              year even though he didn't have accounting experience.

            <div class="article">
              At the age of 22, he opened his first factory, Cheung Kong Industries, and manufactured plastic, which he
              foresaw as a booming industry and he was right. In 1958, he ventured into real estate and steadily built
              his empire. By 1979, Li bought Hutchison Whampoa and sealed his status of being a business tycoon. He
              attributed his wealth to good knowledge and a no-debt policy. Indeed, the qualities he developed in
              childhood earned him the title: “Superman” of the Asian business world.
