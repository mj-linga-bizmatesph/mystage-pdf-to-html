              Martial arts film actor Jackie Chan was dubbed as Bruce Lee&#039;s
              successor at first, but his comedic approach to movies coupled
              with his death-defying stunts created an entirely different
              reputation for him. At the age of 7, he learned Chinese opera, a
              mix of singing, stagecraft, martial arts, and acrobatics. It gave
              him a tough routine—he woke up at 5 AM and finished at midnight,
              and he was also physically punished for mistakes. But by the time
              he was 17, he mastered his impressive stunt skills.

              After doing minor jobs, Jackie&#039;s breakthrough came when he
              did Snake In The Eagle&#039;s Shadow and Drunken Master. He
              attempted to continue his success in the US through serious roles,
              but his films failed. However, his fame continuously rose in Hong
              Kong as he produced more comedies. By this time, Chan created his
              own agency, Jackie&#039;s Angels, to scout for talent for his
              movies, and Jackie Chan Stuntmen Association, where he personally
              trained and gave medical insurance to members.

              Jackie&#039;s first hit in America was Rumble in the Bronx, which
              prompted the release of his other films in the States namely the
              Rush Hour series, The Tuxedo, Shanghai Noon, and Mr. Nice Guy. He
              even landed a role in the animated series, Kung Fu Panda. He
              became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador and he was also named as the
              first anti-drug ambassador of Singapore. Jackie&#039;s
              perseverance has taught many that success is more than just
              “breaking a leg;” it&#039;s also all about willpower and passion.
