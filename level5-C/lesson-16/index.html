              The Earth is too small for someone like Elon Musk. His dreams are
              beyond an ordinary man&#039;s as he visualizes setting up a
              business where no man ever has—the moon. Elon has shown potential
              since he was young. At age 12, he sold Blastar, a computer game he
              himself developed, but even though he showed incredible talent, he
              did not quite fit in with his peers. Nevertheless, Elon continued
              to pursue knowledge through books, even finishing volumes of
              encyclopedias.

              Elon left South Africa for Canada when he was 17, and studied in
              Queen&#039;s University in Ontario. He then, proceeded to go to
              the US later on and took business and physics at the University of
              Pennsylvania, where he graduated with flying colors. By 1995, he
              and his brother launched Zip2, a company that developed city
              guides online for newspaper publishers. After Zip2 was sold in
              1999, he co-founded X.com which later merged with Confinity and
              became Paypal.

              SolarCity was funded by Musk to create a source of alternative
              energy, but his vision was not limited to solar panels when he
              founded Tesla, an avant-garde vehicle maker. Following his passion
              further, Elon launched SpaceX, which partnered with NASA to
              develop further technology. Elon continued to innovate towards his
              wildest dreams by working in the automotive, space, financial, and
              artificial intelligence fields and aiming for the colonization of
              Mars. Truly, he is a man who dreams big.
