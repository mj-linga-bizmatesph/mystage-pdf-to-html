              Everyone knows Michael Jordan, but not many know about him not being accepted in his high school
              basketball team. After high school, he went to the University of North Carolina under a basketball
              scholarship and was named Rookie of the Year for 1982. He was also a member of the US Olympic basketball
              team which won gold in California. Jordan left after his junior year and was selected as the third pick by
              the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in the 1984 draft.

              The Chicago Bulls were a losing team when Jordan got drafted, but he was able to turn it around with his
              style of play and competitiveness. The whole world became a fan of his hang time and incredible ability to
              leap. In his first season, he was selected for the All-Star team and NBA Rookie of the Year. During
              training, Michael forced himself to shoot under pressure and challenged himself to beat the difficult
              players. He never accepted defeat. For everyone, “Michael never loses.”

            <div class="article">
              Chicago Bulls became a force to be reckoned with in the '80s and Jordan was its star, but he retired
              shortly and tried his luck at baseball. He later came back and helped the Bulls win the championship
              again, allowing them to dominate the basketball world. Now retired, Michael is the most decorated NBA
              player with six NBA championships, five regular-season MVP Awards, and three All-Star MVPs. He proved that
              the ball had always been in his court; he just had to learn to throw it the right way.
