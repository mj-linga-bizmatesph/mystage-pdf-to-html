              Have you ever wondered why, among the Beatles, only Paul McCartney has stood the test of time? Since they
              have disbanded in the late 60s, Paul remains very much visible. From launching exhibits of his paintings,
              to receiving awards for his musical contribution, the composer of “Yesterday” has certainly made a name
              for himself beyond the Beatles. He was knighted in 1997 as recognition for his achievements in the music
              industry.

            <div class="article">
              What sets Paul apart from his contemporaries is his talent to do other things. Besides singing and
              composing songs, he is engaged in writing his own books as well. With all the money he gets from his past
              works, he could comfortably stop working, but Paul continues to do his forte and explains that he wants to
              keep doing a good job and that money is not really what keeps a person going, but it's the freedom to do
              what one wants and to live one's dreams.

              Paul McCartney did not become popular unintentionally – it was a product of conscious effort. Fame can be
              fleeting in the world of show business, as attested by one-hit wonders in the past. So, his choice to
              continuously live his passion by doing what he does best has certainly paved the way for him to be an
              icon. For that, “Yesterday” will remain a song associated with McCartney, but it will never be a word to
              describe his career.
