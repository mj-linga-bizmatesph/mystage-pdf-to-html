              Jim Kwik was “the boy with the broken brain.” After suffering from
              a head trauma at the age of 5, he struggled with learning and
              reading. Because of his condition, he was bullied and he became
              extremely shy and withdrawn. It took Jim an extra 3 years to learn
              reading and he taught himself how to do so through comic books. He
              loved the X-Men because he felt that they were like him—an
              outcast—and because of this, he went out every weekend to search
              for Professor X&#039;s school.

              College wasn’t any different for Jim. He tried his best to catch
              up but still couldn&#039;t. One time, he went on a trip with a
              friend and his family. When asked how school was, Jim broke down
              and narrated about his condition and how hard it was for him to
              keep up. His friend&#039;s dad asked him, “Why are you in school?
              What do you want to share to the world?” and told him that he was
              close to achieving them all. Those words guided him to overcome
              his depression and help others out.

              Jim became more confident and started having a lot of friends. He
              figured that school taught what to learn but never how to learn.
              He discovered that brains can be rebuilt and that his was not
              broken—it just needed a better owner&#039;s manual. Jim went
              beyond his own limiting beliefs and made it his passion to help
              others do the same. He was able to become a brain performance
              coach to notable figures such as Elon Musk and Will Smith, and
              even got to meet the X-Men cast in one of his seminars.
