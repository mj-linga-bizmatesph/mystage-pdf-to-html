              As many successful people will tell you, the road to success is
              not a hundred-meter dash, but an endless marathon littered with
              pitfalls, traps, mistakes, tragedies, and distractions. Failure is
              practically guaranteed at some point along the way and yet, there
              are people who encounter seemingly insurmountable hardships and
              come out the other end stronger, wiser, and more determined than
              ever.

              Although things like careful planning, competence, hard work, and
              even instinct come into play, the element of persistence in the
              formula of success can not be overstated. After all, everyone
              takes a hit from time to time - but as Rocky Balboa so eloquently
              stated, “It ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you
              can get hit and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done.”
