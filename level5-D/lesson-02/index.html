              Billionaire entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson started off with a
              resume that would impress no one. He was a high-school dropout
              with below-average reading and math skills. He was a barefoot,
              long-haired hippie who dabbled in get-rich-quick schemes that
              failed one after another. Today, however, Branson is one of the
              wealthiest people alive and his Virgin Group has stakes in
              business spanning industries such as airline, hospitality,
              finance, and even space travel.

              Courage, imagination and a whole lot of perseverance aided in
              turning him from dyslexic dropout to billionaire magnate. While
              his family encouraged his entrepreneurial spirit, much of his
              strengths were born out of his struggles and mistakes. His
              learning disability made it hard for him to read and understand
              concepts. Even today, he struggles with reports. But dyslexia was
              not his only challenge; financial problems, tax evasion, law
              suits, and even jail time constantly tested his resolve.

              Things got really difficult when he set up Virgin Atlantic Airways
              in 1984. During the company’s certification flight, birds flew
              into an engine which exploded. In order to pay for a replacement,
              Branson had to pull nearly 1 million dollars from his subsidiaries
              to cover the costs. In 1992, troubles continued to plague Branson
              and he was forced to sell Virgin Music Group to appease his
              bankers. Yet for every setback, Branson’s tenacity and spirit came
              out on top forging him into the man he is today.
