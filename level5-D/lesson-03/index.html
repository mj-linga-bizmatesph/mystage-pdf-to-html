              Many of us are familiar with the movie, “Rocky” and the dogged
              determination of its titular character. However, what many may not
              know is that Rocky is but a reflection of the man who created him,
              Sylvester Stallone. At the time, Stallone was a virtual unknown,
              had a total of $106 to his name, and had just sold his only
              friend, a dog, for a measly $25 to make ends meet after years of
              struggling as an actor. Then one night, Stallone saw something
              that would change his life forever.

              It was March 24, 1975. The legendary Muhammad Ali was up against
              Chuck Wepner. Ali was expected to destroy Wepner, but what
              happened stunned the world. This underdog stood toe to toe with
              the greatest fighter who ever lived and showed the world what he
              was worth. Wepner lasted until the 15th round and against 40:1
              odds, even knocked the champ down. Stallone was inspired. He began
              writing a script about “a man who was going to stand up to life,
              take a shot, and go the distance”.

            <div class="article">
              With script in hand, Stallone found producers who loved it. There
              was a problem though, they didn’t want Stallone in the film. They
              offered a whopping $375,000 for the script, but still he refused.
              Acting was his dream and it wasn’t up for sale. Eventually, the
              producers relented and Stallone took home $35,000 and the lead
              role. The first thing he did after getting paid was buy his dog
              back (which ended up costing $15,000). In 1976, Rocky won best
              picture and Stallone had achieved his dreams.
