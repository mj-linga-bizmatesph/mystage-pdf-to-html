              However difficult life may seem, there is always something you can
              do, and succeed at. It matters that you don’t just give up.

              Just when life was about to begin for the 21-year old Stephen
              Hawking, the Cambridge Ph.D. student was diagnosed with
              amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and was given a couple of
              years left to live. His organs would slowly deteriorate and his
              muscles would weaken to the point where he would be unable to move
              or speak on his own. Although his mind would be unaffected, his
              body would become utterly useless. With such a tragic fate upon
              him, one might just assume to give up on life. Not Stephen.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Intent on making the most out of his time on Earth, he strove to
              unravel life’s purpose. He completed his doctorate degree, got
              married, had children, published numerous books, and inspired
              people all over the world with his story. Unfortunately, ALS
              continued to exact a toll on his body and Hawking was left
              completely immobile and unable to speak or move without the aid of
              sophisticated technology and software.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Yet, with all odds against him, Stephen’s tenacity for life
              allowed him to accomplish more than what most of us could ever
              attain in this lifetime. Although one can’t help but imagine what
              could have been had he not been afflicted with ALS, Stephen
              credits his success and his work to his illness which afforded him
              time to ponder our universe’s great mysteries. And even though
              Stephen Hawking passed at the age of 76 in March 2018, his
              thoughts, theories, and story will echo through the ages.
