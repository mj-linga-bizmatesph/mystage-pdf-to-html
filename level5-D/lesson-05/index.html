              Being a housewife did not stop Martha Stewart from building a multi-million-dollar empire. 
              She made a career out of a vocation deemed by some as one only fitting for simpleminded people. 
              Martha’s talent is just impossible to contain. Even in trivial tasks, such as decorating the house or stuffing a turkey, 
              Martha Stewart introduced novel ways of making anything look elegant and exude a million-dollar appeal.

              Unfortunately, her success took a toll on her private life. Her husband left her just when things were beginning to take off. 
              Yet, this setback in her personal life did not slow her journey forward. She became a household name, a TV personality, an author, and business investor. 
              Her success in everything she attempted made her seem unstoppable. But it was not until controversy hit that she shone brightest 
              and enthralled the world further with her conquering spirit.

              Martha Stewart was indicted for inside trading and incarcerated for five months. Instead of getting disheartened, she took her imprisonment in stride 
              and served her time as soon as possible. As soon as she was released, she began working to get her business back on track. 
              Although she found herself in trouble again for breaching her contract years later, she braved the ordeal without shedding a single tear or losing composure
              at a time when there was no other way to go but break down.
