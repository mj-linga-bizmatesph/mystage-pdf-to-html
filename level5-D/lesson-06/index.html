              I’m convinced that about half of what separates the successful
              entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance.

              Apple is undoubtedly one of the world’s most powerful companies.
              It is known for its great products, innovative culture, and the
              man behind the vision, Steve Jobs. Yet for all his success, Steve
              Jobs’ life was dotted with tragedies and hardships. As a child
              born into a poor family, Steve was given up for adoption as a
              baby. However, every cloud has a silver lining as his foster
              father introduced his adopted son to the world of electronics - a
              passion that would eventually help Steve change the world.

            <div class="article">
              In 1976, Steve founded Apple Computers with his business partner
              Steve Wozniak. Although things went well initially, Steve would
              eventually be removed from the company he helped found due to poor
              business results and clashing personalities. Refusing to go down,
              Steve went out to start his next venture, NeXT Computer.
              Unfortunately, NeXT also struggled similarly with sales and ended
              up being acquired by the very company he first established –
              Apple.

              As tumultuous as all of this may have been, Steve took this as a
              chance to continue to revolutionize the industry and the company.
              In 2003, Steve was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and after
              battling his illness for almost a decade, passed away in October
              2011 at 56 years old though not before he lived to see the fruits
              of his labours. Steve Jobs may not have been the easiest person to
              work with, but it was precisely his determination that helped
              Apple become the giant it is today.

            Steve Jobs was notoriously hard to work with. Yet, it was his
            determination and stubbornness that contributed in part to Apple’s
            success. Do you know of anyone similar?
