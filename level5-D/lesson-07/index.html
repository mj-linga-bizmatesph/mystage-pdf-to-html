              Dustin Hoffman is probably one of the most critically-acclaimed actors in Hollywood. However, before he shot to stardom, he had to play many less glamorous “roles”. 
              He waited tables, washed dishes, bussed tables, delivered newspapers and even worked in a psychiatric ward. Yet, even with these hardships, 
              he never pitied himself. He embraced his professions wholeheartedly, no matter what they were, and considered them all valuable learning experiences.

            <div class="article">
              Looking quite ordinary, it did not occur to Dustin that he would one day become an actor. He never really had any concrete plan for his drab life until 
              he enrolled in acting class. The usually nonchalant Dustin took an immediate liking to this creative outlet and discovered that it gave him so much joy. 
              For the first time in his life, he felt that he did not have to exert much effort to really stand out. Acting had become his calling 
              – the one thing he was meant to do on this earth.

              The problem was that he wasn’t the only one who thought that. Many others – far better-looking – thought they deserved just as much consideration and opportunity. 
              Yet, what Dustin lacked in traditional leading man good-looks, he made up for in sheer talent and persistence. He never turned down an audition, 
              even if he was not feeling well, and nearly passed out during his audition for the film The Graduate. Dustin Hoffman would eventually go on to win 2 Academy Awards for his work.
