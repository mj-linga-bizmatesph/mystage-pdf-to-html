              It would be difficult to talk about the concept of perseverance and persistence without bringing up Thomas Edison. After all, 
              he is the man who famously said “I have not failed. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work”. With such a mindset, it’s no wonder that 
              he was able to create one of the most significant inventions of our time, the light bulb. Yet, his road to success was not an easy one. 
              Thomas Edison never had it easy, but what he lacked in luck, he made up for in sheer grit.
            <div class="article">
              Thomas was not considered “school smart”. In fact, he did so poorly in school that his mother, a former teacher herself, was forced to school him at home. 
              However, Thomas loved reading and experimenting with whatever machinery and gadgetry he could get his hands on. 
              This passion of his fully manifested itself when he decided to become a full-time inventor. His biggest challenge as an inventor came in 1878 when 
              he dedicated himself to the invention of the light bulb.

              Edison and his team worked on at least 3000 theories on how to produce an efficient incandescent lamp. Although they found a decent solution, 
              the materials used for the filament (the part that glows in the bulb) simply wasn’t long-lasting enough. So, Edison began his long search for the solution. 
              He painstakingly analyzed upwards of 6000 possible materials and finally found one that would pass his rigorous testing methods. He had done it. 
              Before his death in 1931, Edison patented 1,093 inventions.
