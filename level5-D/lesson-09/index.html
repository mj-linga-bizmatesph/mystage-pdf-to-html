              Jack Ma made billions in an industry nobody thought would flourish
              in China – e-commerce. Yet for all his success, Jack’s past is
              riddled with failures. He failed his school entrance exams 8
              times, was rejected from nearly 30 job interviews, and failed to
              even get a job at KFC. According to Ma, when KFC entered China the
              fast food chain hired 23 out of 24 applicants. Ma was the only one
              that didn’t make the cut. Yet, even after all this, he didn’t give
              up. He felt he was destined for more.

            <div class="article">
              In 1995, Ma found himself in the United States and in front of a
              computer connected to the internet for the very first time.
              Intrigued, he made his first search, ‘beer’. Results from
              different countries were found but not a single hit from his own
              country of China. So, out of curiosity, he searched ‘China’ and to
              his surprise, there was nothing. Jack Ma knew then and there that
              it was time for the people of China to join the digital
              revolution.

              A couple of failed ventures and 4 years later, Alibaba was founded
              in Ma’s basement with zero outside funding and 17 of his friends.
              As time passed and the world began to wake up to Alibaba’s
              potential amidst the emerging Chinese market, Alibaba attracted
              more and more foreign investors such as Softbank and Goldman
              Sachs. Ma’s persistence and determination in business and life has
              now made him one of the richest men in China and a company that
              rivals giants such as Amazon and Walmart.
