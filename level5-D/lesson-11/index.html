              Energy drinks, like fast food, take merciless beatings from
              nutritionists and the public has been given a plethora of factual
              information to discourage people from consuming these beverages.
              So why do people continue to do so? Could it be that the marketing
              strategy is just too effective? Red Bull, for instance, enjoys
              increasing profits in spite of continuous attacks from
              nutritionists and experts. Yet, what people have called “poison”
              is the life’s work of Austrian magnate Dietrich Mateschitz.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Mateschitz came from a marketing background and the idea for Red
              Bull occurred to him in 1982 while learning about the popularity
              of “tonics” in Asia. However, before launching the energy drink
              with his Thai partner, Chaleo Yoovidhya, a market research firm
              predicted that it would be a huge failure. “People didn’t believe
              in the taste, the logo, the brand name”. It was incredibly
              disheartening and disastrous. So, he did what anyone in his
              position would do. He went ahead anyway.

            <div class="article">
              Dietrich poured the last of his money and advertising genius into
              Red Bull and eventually beat the odds. He even found a way to
              promote its edgy and rebellious culture by leveraging the fact
              that the drink was banned in certain countries. To push this image
              further, Red Bull sponsors extreme sports, races, and more
              recently, Red Bull Stratos in which skydiver Felix Baumgartner
              literally dived from space at 1,342 km/h. No better way of
              promoting Red Bull’s slogan “It gives you wings” than that.

              Do you think that marketing research should always dictate a
