              In the Philippines, the easiest way to placate a child is by
              promising him/her a visit to Jollibee, the most famous fast food
              chain in the country. Although it is now considered one of the top
              10 Philippine companies and among Asia’s most admired with over
              2,000 locations including China and the United States, its owner
              Tony Tan Caktiong, describes the rise of Jollibee as “a story of
              finding opportunity amidst difficult times.”

            <div class="article">
              Tony was born into a poor family that migrated from China to the
              Philippines in hopes of finding better opportunities. At 22, Tony
              opened two ice cream parlours and offered bigger scoops of ice
              cream to set himself apart from the competition. Soon after, he
              began to realize that people were craving other kinds of food. He
              introduced hamburgers which soon overtook ice cream sales. In 1978
              he made the full shift to hamburgers and never looked back.

              Jollibee started expanding but as it started to gain popularity,
              global brands started entering the Philippine market – one of them
              being McDonalds. Many of Tony’s friends and advisors tried
              convincing Tony that he would never be able to survive against the
              global giant, yet Tony remained true to his vision. “That was a
              moment of truth for us. If I had not persisted, I would have sold
              out the business right then.” Thanks to his determination,
              Jollibee still remains #1 in the Philippines to this day.
