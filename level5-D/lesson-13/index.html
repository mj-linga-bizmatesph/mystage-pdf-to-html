              Before Amazon or Ebay came online, there was something called the
              door-to-door salesperson. It is a traditional style of business in
              which a salesperson sells products or services from one house to
              another. In the world of door-to-door, there was one exceptional
              man who had inspired a lot of businessmen and consumers of his
              time through an incredible story of will, determination, and guts.
              His name was Bill Porter.

            <div class="article">
              Bill was born with cerebral palsy that caused slurred speech and a
              contorted body. However, he was taught by his mother at a very
              young age to never dwell on his disability. After high school, he
              began job hunting but faced rejection after rejection. One day
              after receiving yet another ‘No’ , Bill saw his mother patiently
              waiting for him in the parking lot. With that, he stepped back in
              and dared the manager to give him a chance. Impressed by his
              determination, the manager gave Bill a shot.

            <div class="article">
              Every day Bill would walk 8 – 10 miles to offer, sell and deliver
              products. Some would buy, some wouldn’t, and some would mock him;
              yet he never thought of quitting, for he had always lived by his
              mother’s words: patience and persistence. After months of hard
              work, Bill was awarded Salesman of the Year. His story of his
              courage and perseverance made him a legend and companies like Nike
              and Amway invited him to deliver motivational talk to their staff
              and continued to do until his passing.
