              It is impossible to live without failing at something…unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case you fail by default.

              Behind the magical world of Harry Potter is a woman who used to live on social welfare with an infant to take care of. Word has it that she ran away from the 
              child’s father when he started becoming abusive. Whatever the cause of their divorce was, the fall out left Joanne Rowling emotionally devastated, broke, 
              and struggling with deep depression. Having an infant daughter made looking for a job impossible and so she did the only thing she knew and loved. She wrote.

              With nowhere to go and zero income, she completed a manuscript of her book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, and presented it to numerous publishers. 
              However, she received only rejection and discouraging remarks. Most of them said that there was no future for her in children’s books and that no sane writer 
              should expect success in the genre she was writing. But with her back against the wall, she had no choice but to keep on going and hope that 
              someone would see value in her work.

              When a publisher finally gave her story the opportunity to get published, she was more than happy for the meager $4000 she received. 
              But Harry Potter worked its own magic on the readers – they couldn’t get enough of the world and characters that she had created and wanted to know what would happen next. 
              J.K. Rowling’s creation would go on to become a massive cultural icon and the Harry Potter brand is now estimated at over 25 billion dollars in value.
