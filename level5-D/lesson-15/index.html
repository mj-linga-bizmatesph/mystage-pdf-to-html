              James Burke has secured his position as one of the most courageous CEOs by the way he responded to the crisis that hit Johnson & Johnson in 1982. Before the crisis, 
              J&J’s biggest brand was the pain-killer Tylenol with over one hundred million users and accounting for 19% of J&J’s revenues. That year, seven people in Chicago died 
              after someone had, for reasons unknown, tampered with Tylenol bottles and replaced the capsules with cyanide. A public outcry followed and J&J was in major trouble. 
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Burke immediately put together a seven-member team to deal with the matter. His directive to the team was to first and foremost protect the wellbeing of consumers 
              and save the product second. As such, the company’s first move was to alert the public to stop taking Tylenol until the investigation was over. 
              J&J then deployed a hotline that consumers could call and also conducted an immediate product recall that resulted in the disposing of 31 million bottles and a 
              loss of 100 million dollars.

            <div class="article">
              Although J&J understood that they were not responsible for the deaths, they took accountability all the same. With this act, J&J secured 
              its position in the minds of the people as a trustworthy company. Eventually, Tylenol was re-introduced to the market in a triple-sealed, 
              tamper-proof packaging and eventually, tamper-resistant caplets. By 1983, Tylenol’s market share had risen to 35% thanks to Burke’s speedy response, 
              effective PR, and, most of all, their emphasis on putting people first.
