              Sudha Chandran was born to dance and practically started dancing as soon as she could walk. By the age of five, her parents were convinced that she 
              had a special talent. In order to provide their young daughter with opportunity to learn from the best, they begged the principal of the most prestigious 
              dancing school in Mumbai to accept her despite her young age. Although the admission rules were usually quite strict, the headmaster relented 
              upon seeing the young prodigy dance with his own eyes.

              Bharatanatyam, a traditional Indian dance takes years and years of dedication and skill to master. She became the school’s most diligent 
              student and at 15 years old, had grown up to become an incredibly promising Bharatanatyam professional dancer. However, tragedy struck. 
              Sudha was involved in a bus accident and in a cruel twist of fate, her leg had developed gangrene and was amputated. That was it. 
              Her dancing career and everything she had worked so hard for since she could walk was gone.

              Then one day, The Jaipur Foot, a rubber-based prosthetic leg, came to her rescue. After three hard years of rehabilitation and retraining, 
              she found the courage and strength to step back onto the dance floor. Although it was a jarring transition at first, her perseverance shined 
              through and she eventually found herself back on stage and even found success in television and film. To this day, she still continues to dance 
              and inspire those with her story of determination.
