              I failed. It was a bad beginning. Yes, and I had later troubles. I suppose I never would have done anything if I hadn’t kept coming back.

              Hershey’s is a name that would bring a smile to the face of any chocolate lover in the world. However, the story of the man behind the brand wasn’t always so happy. 
              Milton Hershey had come from a broken home and he was raised by his mother, Fanny, who inspired a deep appreciation for hard work in her son. 
              At 14 years old, Milton left school to start an apprenticeship with a candy maker. Over the next four years, Milton learned the foundations of 
              the business and eventually set up his own shop.

            <div class="article">
              For five years, Milton poured all of his time and energy into his shop but success eluded him. The store closed in failure, but never one to give up, 
              he opened up two more shops – first in Chicago, then in New York – and faced failure yet again in both instances. After 3 failed businesses, 
              most people would have just given up, but Hershey persisted. He returned to the place of his apprenticeship in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and started again. 
              This time, Hershey felt things were going to be different.

              He was right. The Lancaster Caramel Company thrived and Milton began distributing caramels all over the US. However, not one to rest on his laurels, 
              he began to turn his eyes towards the next big thing. Chocolate. 7 years later in 1900, Hershey sold his caramel business to start the company we all know and love today, 
              Hershey’s. By bringing what was once a Swiss delicacy to the masses, Hershey was able to achieve success and bring joy and prosperity to his home town and people around the world.
