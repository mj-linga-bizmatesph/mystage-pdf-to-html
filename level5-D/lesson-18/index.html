              Park Jae Sang is better known to the world as Psy – the man behind the 2012 viral hit, “Gangnam Style.” Although the Gangnam Style sensation 
              seemed to have happened overnight, Psy’s road to fame was anything but. Psy had always loved music, but being born in to a family of entrepreneurs in 
              South Korea meant that his future was almost completely out of his hands. He was sent to the US to study business to prepare for a role in his father’s company, 
              but Psy had other plans. 
            <div class="article">
              After spending all of his money intended for business studies on musical instruments, Psy enrolled at Berklee College to study music. 
              Just as things were looking up, news of his father’s passing sent him back to South Korea. Yet, during his lowest moments he would often find escape by writing music. 
              Unfortunately, his cheeky lyrics and off-beat sense of humor did not sit well with certain conservative groups which resulted in the banning of some of his work. 
              But Psy would not give up.

            <div class="article">
              Fast forward six studio albums later, Psy was still a minor player in the booming K-Pop scene, but that would all soon change. Word has it that T-Pain, a rapper, 
              shared Psy’s video via Twitter and what followed surpassed everyone’s expectations. More and more people including Justin Bieber began sharing his 
              single resulting in the viral smash-hit that would soon become the first YouTube video to exceed 2 billion views. Despite all the hurdles and challenges, 
              Psy had made it.
