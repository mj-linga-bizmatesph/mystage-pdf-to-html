              Spider-Man, The X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange and many more heroes came from the genius of one Stan Lee. 
              As American comic books continue to make great strides into mainstream popular culture, the story of Stan and his steadfast dedication and perseverance 
              to see these characters brought to the masses is equal to, if not greater than the comic book accomplishments of the aforementioned super heroes.

            <div class="article">
              Prior to Stan Lee’s iconic characters, superheroes had always been too perfect. They were big, invincible to harm, never made mistakes, and superior to humans in every way. 
              Stan changed this trend by giving the reader characters that had faults and every day problems. Spider-Man was a nerd, Iron Man was an alcoholic, and the X-Men were social outcasts. By grounding his characters with real-world problems, Lee was able to teach his readers about the real value of persistence and responsibility.

            <div class="article">
              For generations of readers, Lee’s comics would inspire them to face life’s challenges, to do the right thing even when it’s hard, and to never ever give up. 
              As a public figure, Stan had always been adored by the masses and continued to inspire his fans around the world with public appearances up until his passing on 
              November 12, 2018 at the age of 95. Marvel comics and films are now a multi-billion dollar business and continue to inspire millions of people around the world with their stories.
