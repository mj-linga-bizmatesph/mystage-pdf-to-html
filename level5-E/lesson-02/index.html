              We’ve spent our lives enriched by the communities around us, and it’s a privilege to be able to give back to causes that can help the world around 
              us be a safer and kinder place.

              In 2009, Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett came together and proposed to change the world. Not with some new technology or real estate development, 
              but through philanthropy. The three called upon the world’s rich and powerful to dedicate at least half of their net worth to charities and causes of their 
              choosing within their lifetime or after their death in attempts to  establish “a moral commitment” to the betterment of the world. 
              This became known as “The Giving Pledge”.

            <div class="article">
              Although some initially dismissed The Pledge as a publicity stunt, its impact on the world has been tremendous. As of 2018, The organisation has signed 
              over 183 magnates to the cause in over 22 countries, including Mark Zuckerberg and Richard Branson, with an estimated $735 billion in pledges. 
              Once a member of the organisation, group strategy sessions are held to educate donors on how to best make an impact within their own unique 
              spheres of influence and interest.  
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              With the members’ combined years of experience, connections, and business acumen, the Giving Pledge is a bright spot in world of philanthropy. 
              Everything from education and poverty alleviation to  healthcare research and victim support have benefitted from the Giving Pledge. 
              By successfully rallying a large portion of the world’s wealth towards action and the common good, the future of our planet may not be as dark and 
              dour as some would have us believe.
