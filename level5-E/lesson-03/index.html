              The world owes much to former US Vice President Al Gore’s efforts
              to bring the issue of climate change to the public arena. His
              Oscar-wining film, An Inconvenient Truth, is just part of his
              decades-long campaign to alert the world to this “planetary
              emergency”. The film brought him much criticism and disapproval
              from many political and business leaders but it accomplished what
              he set out to do – which was to spark the discussion of the issue
              and perhaps from there, work on the solution.

              Al Gore had been involved in environmental activism for a number
              of decades. Even as a freshman congressman, he held the first
              congressional hearings on climate change and continued to pursue
              this topic throughout the 1980s. Gore was met with much opposition
              and criticism especially in the 90s when he pushed for the passage
              of the Kyoto protocol, which called for countries to reduce
              greenhouse gas emissions. He was strongly opposed by the US senate
              by a vote of 95 – 0.

            <div class="article">
              In 2007, Gore’s relentless pursuit for change awarded him a joint
              Nobel Peace Prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
              Change. To this day, Gore continues his environmental activism and
              has taken it upon himself to take action wherever and whenever
              possible. He continues to write books, give lectures, and create
              various foundations and organizations such as We Can Solve It, The
              Alliance for Climate Protection and the Climate Project to fulfill
              his self-determined “mission in life”.
