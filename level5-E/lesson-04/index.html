              Angelina Jolie is everything you would expect from a Hollywood
              star. Acclaimed by numerous media outlets as one of the sexiest
              women alive, her career in film has made her an icon known for
              playing strong females characters such as a spies, assassins, and
              tomb-raiding thrill seekers. Recently, her turn as Maleficent, a
              tormented sorceress hell-bent on revenge cast her in the spotlight
              once again. Although Maleficent eventually becomes a villain, the
              woman behind the character is anything but.

            <div class="article">
              While filming Tomb Raider in Cambodia, she witnessed the plight of
              the local refugees and was horrified to discover that millions of
              people had lost their homes and national identity to war in the
              area. With no one to turn to and no country to call home, Angelina
              Jolie took it upon herself to help in any way she could. Her
              desire to make a change eventually led to the adoption of three
              orphaned children from Cambodia, Vietnam, and Ethiopia and finding
              fulfillment in philanthropic pursuits.

              Although her career in Hollywood is as bright as ever, Angelina
              Jolie continues to remain active in disaster relief, wildlife
              conservation, community development, child immigration, education,
              and human rights initiatives around the world. Balancing all of
              this on top of her role as Special Envoy to the United Nations
              High Commissioner for Refugees while being a mother to 6 children
              has many of us convinced that Angelina Jolie is more than just a
              strong woman in her movies, she’s the real deal.

            Angelina Jolie has recently combined her love for film and
            philanthropy by directing films related to global human rights
            issues. Is it possible for you to take a similar approach with the
            work you do?
