              Alfred Nobel is perhaps best known for being the man behind the
              Nobel Prize; the highest honor bestowed to men and women for their
              outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, medicine,
              literature, and works of peace. Yet, before this, Alfred’s
              success, fame and fortune had come from something much more
              destructive and far less peaceful. Dynamite. Though business was
              figuratively and literally booming, fulfillment for Alfred Nobel
              ultimately came from a place he did not expect.

            <div class="article">
              Alfred had developed an interest in chemistry and volatile
              explosives at an early age. His curiosity and talent eventually
              led to the creation of dynamite alongside numerous other
              inventions. Throughout the course of his life, Alfred Nobel was
              issued 355 patents and his business had even gone on to establish
              more than 90 armaments factories regardless of his pacifistic
              sensibilities. His keen business mind had amassed him great
              wealth, yet his personal success would soon be called into
              question.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              In 1888 a local French newspaper erroneously published Alfred’s
              obituary stating “the merchant of death is dead” going on to say
              that he had become rich by “finding ways to kill more people
              faster than ever before”. Alfred’s heart sank. Were death and
              destruction his only legacy? He would not have it so. Upon his
              death, he set aside 94% (nearly 470 million USD) of his assets to
              establish the five Nobel prizes in hopes that his legacy would be
              one of building great things instead of destroying them.
