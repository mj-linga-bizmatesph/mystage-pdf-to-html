              If you take any world problem, any issue on the planet, the solution to that problem certainly includes education. In education, the roadblock is the laptop.

              From the industrial revolution to the digital boom, technology has always been a huge economic impetus. Yet, for those developing countries whose 
              children lack access to modern technology, the future was uncertain indeed. Enter Nicholas Negroponte; an MIT professor, angel investor, and visionary 
              with a passion for helping the less fortunate. Nicholas believed that if given access to affordable 21st century technology and education, impoverished 
              children would have the means to change the world.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Nicholas launched his One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) initiative in 2005 and proposed to provide a fully functional, self-powering laptop for only $100. 
              Complete with a durable body, a Linux-based OS, and tools focused on developing creativity, media outlets such as the New York Times called it, 
              “The laptop that will save the world.” Unfortunately, “The $100 laptop” (eventually closer to $200) ran into numerous production, marketing, 
              and political problems that eventually derailed Nicholas’ hopes.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Before its eventual collapse in 2014, OLPC managed to provide millions of units worldwide and spawned numerous associations. Although these organizations 
              are now mostly defunct, the now 74 year-old continues to pursue his vision of a universally connected world that provides free education and Internet for everyone. 
              He believes that “children are our most valuable natural resource”, and continues to forge ahead with new ventures to make the world a better, more accessible place.
