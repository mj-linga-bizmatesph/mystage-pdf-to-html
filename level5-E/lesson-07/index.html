              Philanthropy should not be a solo act – not the act of a single person or organization, but the undertaking of many.

              In the Philippines, the name Ayala is nearly synonymous with business leadership and development. It is one of the country’s oldest and largest 
              business conglomerates with interests in real estate, banking, telecommunications, electronics, IT, and public utility. Moreover, the 
              Ayala name is so closely associated with philanthropy and social responsibility that all of its businesses and employees are ready and willing 
              to rise to the occasion when they are called to give.

            <div class="article">
              In 2011, two Ayala companies, the Bank of the Philippine Islands and Globe Telecom, launched a platform named BPI Globe BanKO ( a play on words meaning “my bank”) 
              to help and empower micro entrepreneurs by providing financial advice and aid to those who could not access traditional banks. 
              However, BanKO simply did not have enough funds to lend out. Upon seeing this, Ayala Group CEO, Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, gathered 120 of his 
              top executives for lunch to tackle the issue.

            <div class="article">
              Under Jaime Augusto’s leadership, the Ayala executives pooled together their resources and in one lunch hour, raised 25 million pesos to be used as a way to fund 
              the thousands of mom and pop stores across the country. While some companies may regard corporate social responsibility as a threat to sustained profitability, 
              the Ayala group sees it as a way to create new opportunities to build competitiveness, a higher level of trust among stakeholders, and deepen economic development.
