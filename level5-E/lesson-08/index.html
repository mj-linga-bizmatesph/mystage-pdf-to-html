              Revitalization is not a word describing what we ought to be doing.
              It’s the creation of something out of nothing.

              After the 2011 tsunami that devastated Japan, many people were
              left homeless, jobless, and uncertain about the future. One of the
              hardest hit areas was Miyagi, a tranquil place known for its
              luscious strawberries. For IT entrepreneur Hiroki Iwasa, that
              place was also known as home. At that time, Hiroki was living in
              Tokyo managing his start-up, yet upon news of the disaster, he
              quickly returned home to aid in relief efforts while
              simultaneously discovering the next chapter of his life.

              The agricultural business had been in slow decline for many years
              as more and more young people were leaving rural prefectures like
              Miyagi for big-city dreams. However, when the tsunami wiped out
              nearly all of the strawberry-producing greenhouses in the area,
              the young entrepreneur found fulfillment by combining his years of
              IT expertise with the tried-and-true agricultural methods of the
              local farmers in hopes to revive the local economy and
              revolutionize the stagnating industry.

              Since its inception in 2011, the aptly-named General
              Reconstruction Association (GRA) has applied its reach outside of
              Japan and into India where the technology is being used to not
              only increase the overall quality of its products, but to also
              improve the lives of local farmers. Yet, with all of the success
              GRA has experienced, nothing has been more seemingly fulfilling
              for Hiroki Iwasa than being able to help his home, city, and
              people recover from one of the largest disasters in recent memory.
