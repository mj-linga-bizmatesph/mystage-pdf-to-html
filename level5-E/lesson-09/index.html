              I discovered so late in life that trusting your own heart is your greatest – and only – path to real happiness.

              Imagine this: You’re a senior executive at one of the largest advertising firms in the world. You have a great salary, a loving family, and a life of luxury. 
              Suddenly, it’s all gone. Your job, your money, your marriage, and on top of that, you’re diagnosed with a brain tumor. With nowhere to go and in your fifties, 
              what would you do? For many, it would be so easy to just give up on life, but for Michael Gill, he would find a whole new start and fulfillment 
              at a place he least expected. Starbucks.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              As a self-described “son of privilege”, Michael had always lived at the top of white American society. Now, he found himself working at Starbucks serving 
              those that used to serve him while working under an ethnic minority. Karma it seemed, was certainly having its way. Yet, for all the difficulties, 
              Michael began to see life in a different light. By letting go of his pride, embracing a different philosophy on life, and opening himself to 
              new possibilities Michael found himself with “the best job he’s ever had”  
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              In order to spread what he has learned, Michael came up with the three L’s: Leap (with faith): In situations where you are truly trapped, you’ve got 
              to be willing to take chances. Look (with respect): We tend to only see what we want and ignore everything else. However, by opening our eyes to new people and things, 
              we may discover new possibilities. Listen (to your heart): Growing up in a world where others determine your success will lead to a life of insecurity. 
              Live life on your own terms.
