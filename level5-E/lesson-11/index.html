              Cameron Lyle, a 21 year-old track and field star for the University of New Hampshire had an incredibly bright athletic career ahead of him. 
              With his senior year coming to a close and conference championships just right around the corner, Cameron was set on winning what could be one of 
              the most important athletic events of his life. However, one day after practice, Cameron would be asked to sacrifice his athletic dreams and all that he’d 
              worked for to help a complete stranger.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              A few years prior, Cameron registered with the National Marrow Donor program. The procedure took five minutes and with the odds of being a match so small, 
              he quickly forgot he had even signed up. Yet, when the news came that he was a match for a 28 year-old leukemia patient, the memories came flooding back. 
              Cameron was now being asked to give up his dreams for a stranger who had months to live. There were no guarantees it would work, but there was hope. 
              Cameron made the sacrifice easily.

            <div class="article">
              The procedure was painful and complicated as the patient required nearly 2 liters of marrow. More than 225 times the regular amount. 
              Afterwards, the patient made a full recovery and Cameron’s story went viral. Donor registrants tripled and Cameron became an activist for Be The Match, 
              the same NPO he registered with years ago. Whenever he is asked why he did it, Cameron says “It really starts with you wanting to help someone. 
              There’s not enough of that right now, people helping people.”
