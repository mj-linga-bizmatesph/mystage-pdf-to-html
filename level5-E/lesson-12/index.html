              There are very few people who haven’t heard of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, and his 73 billion dollar fortune. What people might not know though is that Mark and his wife, 
              Priscilla Chan, have promised to donate 99% of their Facebook shares over the course of their lives to their newly established philanthropic effort, 
              the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), that focuses on improving education, advancing science, and championing equal opportunities for all.

            <div class="article">
              According to CZI, access to engineering and technological resources are often very limited. Educators, scientists, and medical researchers are often hindered by 
              software engineering and developer restraints. As a solution, CZI aims to create an organization that allows their partners to access world-class engineering, 
              technical support, grant-making, investing and advocacy resources to aid in the development of world-changing solutions and breakthroughs more efficiently and competently. 
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              According to Zuckerberg and Chan, the most important lesson they have learned as both entrepreneurs and philanthropists is, “to focus on problems we have 
              some unique ability to solve”. With Mark’s engineering and technological expertise combined with Priscilla’s Harvard-educated medical and educational background, 
              CZI certainly has the pedigree to make a tremendous impact on the world and its future generations.
