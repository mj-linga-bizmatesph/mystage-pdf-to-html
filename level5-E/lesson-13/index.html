              Many children grow up with stories of knights in shining armour galloping in on their white horses to save the day. Unfortunately, 
              as inspiring as these stories are, the fact remains that they are just fairy tales. There certainly are no knights in shining armor saving helpless 
              citizens these days…or are there? Well, there is still one person of royal descent in the world that is living up to those legendary stories, 
              William, Duke of Cambridge.     
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              As a member of the British Royal family, William had lived his life in comfort and elegance. Yet, his kind-hearted nature and desire to be of 
              service to his country and people led him to become a full-time helicopter pilot with the East Anglian Air Ambulance (EAAA) after his 5-year 
              tenure with the Royal Air Force. During his time at the EAAA, Prince William worked a four-day-on, four-day-off shift rotation, and although he was paid a salary, 
              he donated his earnings to the EAAA charity.   
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Although being a pilot certainly sounds exciting, William’s experience was oftentimes difficult. His first call as an EAAA pilot was in response to 
              the suicide of a young man which impacted him profoundly. As a result, William and his wife, Kate, founded the charity “Heads Together” to combat mental health issues. 
              Yet, with all of the tragedies he has witnessed, the lives he helped save has certainly given William a sense of fulfillment that far exceeds his royal status and title.

            As a member of the royal family, William may have felt the need to prove himself as being more than just something he was born into. 
            Have you ever felt or experienced something similar?
