              For the foodies out there, Massimo Bottura needs no introduction.
              Yet, for everyone else, he is the chef and owner of Osteria
              Francescana, 2016 and 2018’s World’s Best Restaurant as selected
              by The World’s Best 50 Restaurants’ Academy. With Bottura’s
              restaurant being so successful and serving the most elite of
              people, one would not expect him to have the time nor desire to
              prepare and serve food to the poor. Yet, that is exactly what he
              is doing with his charitable organization, Food for Soul.

              Food for Soul aims to change the way people perceive community
              kitchens, improve food waste, and strengthen communities to best
              aid people in socially vulnerable positions. Soup kitchens are
              typically viewed as sad, dreary places, lacking in energy and
              dignity. Massimo hopes to change this by forming communities of
              interior designers, artists, food suppliers and chefs to create a
              warm atmosphere for people to have a delicious and healthy meal
              using surplus ingredients that are wrongfully discarded.

              According to Food for Soul, nearly one third of all edible food is
              thrown away while upwards of 800 million people are underfed,
              malnourished, and in poverty. By bringing volunteers and industry
              professionals together to combat these issues, Massimo Bottura
              believes that change is possible. After all, no matter if you’re a
              world-class chef, volunteer, or someone down on their luck,
              nothing is more uplifting than a warm meal prepared with love and
              care. Now that’s some food for thought.

            Massimo Bottura and his friends at Food for Soul published a book
            called “Bread is Gold” which contains recipes using simple
            ingredients or food often thrown away. If you could add a recipe to
            the book, what would it be?
