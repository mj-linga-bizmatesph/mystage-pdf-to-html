              You’ll often find Tony March, an unassuming man in his late 60s, volunteering at Metropolitan Ministries preparing meals, cleaning trays, 
              and mopping floors to support the homeless. And although he has been volunteering 20 hours a week for the past 8 years, many of his fellow volunteers 
              know very little about the man. So, it would no doubt come as shock that the man who has been scrubbing plates beside them helped build one of the most 
              celebrated black-owned auto dealerships in the US.

            <div class="article">
              Coming from a very poor childhood Tony understands the difficulties that thousands of underprivileged people face every day. 
              His own alcoholic single mother had often ordered him as a young boy to search through trash bins and dumpsters to feed himself and his 4 other siblings. 
              Yet, through all the hardships, Tony managed to come out on top. However, the memories of his childhood continue to remind him that for every person that 
              makes it out of the slums, thousands remain in suffering. 
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              For the longest time, Tony just wanted to help and had refused to share his story, opting instead for anonymity. Yet, after much deliberation and consideration, 
              Tony has decided to share bits and pieces of his story in hopes that he might inspire others. According to Marvin Karlins, a local author, asked to help with Tony’s story, 
              “He doesn’t want attention, he just wants to help people.” For a man whose company made nearly 700 million dollars in 2016, washing dishes seems to be just as meaningful.
