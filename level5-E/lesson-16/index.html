              It would seem almost impossible to talk about charity, giving, and
              self-fulfilment without mentioning the Make A Wish Foundation. Its
              mission is simple: To grant the wishes of children with
              life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience
              with hope, strength, and joy. Under this philosophy, former CEO of
              Make A Wish’s Greater Bay Area chapter, Patricia Wilson helped
              orchestrate one of the foundation’s greatest and most memorable
              success stories. Batkid.

            <div class="article">
              On Nov. 15, 2013, the foundation along with the San Francisco
              police and fire departments, the late mayor Ed Lee, and thousands
              of volunteers turned the city into Gotham (the fictional city
              protected by DC comics’ Batman) and allowed Miles Scott, a 5
              year-old leukemia patient, to dress up as his favourite hero,
              fight crime, and save the city. The story went viral and Miles was
              even lucky enough to receive a personal video message from
              then-president Barack Obama thanking Batkid for his bravery.

              Initially, Patricia expected 200 people to show up, but thanks to
              social media, upwards of 25,000 came - some even flying in - to
              support Miles. On top of that, an estimated 2 billion people from
              around the world watched the event online. And although Patricia
              has recently stepped down from her post after 17 years of service,
              her work will undoubtedly continue to inspire. “It’s so
              gratifying. We give them a little bit of their childhood back
              that’s been robbed.” Miles Scott is now cancer-free.
