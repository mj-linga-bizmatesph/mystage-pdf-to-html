              It’s harder to be kind than clever. Cleverness is a gift, yet
              kindness is a choice.

              Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is now the richest person in the world
              with an estimated 75 billion-dollar fortune. Although he is an
              active philanthropist, Jeff has recently made a bold move that
              upends the way the super-rich tend to approach giving. While his
              peers tend to focus on creating positive change through long-term
              solutions and advancing causes they are most knowledgeable about,
              Jeff is thinking about taking the completely opposite approach
              through short-term focused “philanthropopulism”.

            <div class="article">
              As otherworldly as some of the super-rich are, the fact remains
              that they are still a part of our society. As a result, some
              believe that the public should have a say as to where donations
              should go. Thus, the concept of philanthropopulism was born. By
              combining democracy with philanthropy, Jeff hopes to be more
              impactful by leaving a certain amount of decision making to the
              people. With this in mind, he defied expectations and took to
              Twitter to openly make a “request for ideas”.
            </div>
            <div class="article">
              Shortly after his open call for ideas on June 16, 2017, Jeff Bezos
              received 40,000 replies and ideas on how to put his fortune to
              good use to make the most impact in the shortest amount of time.
              By focusing on short-term targets, listening to the public, and
              “helping the people in the here and now”, Jeff feels that his
              efforts will yield significant impact in the long run as well.
              Although this strategy has baffled experts, any ideas coming from
              the richest man on the planet might be worth considering.

            <li>
              Recent research suggests that large groups of people make better
              decisions than a small group of experts. What do you think?
