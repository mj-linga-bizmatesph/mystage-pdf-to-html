              Seema Aziz is considered by many as one of the most successful
              business women in Pakistan. Not only is her high-end fashion and
              textile company one of the highest regarded in the country, its
              success has expanded outside Pakistan and into the UAE and UK
              where it has quickly grown into a multimillion-dollar-business.
              However, as successful as her business pursuits are, it is Aziz’s
              philanthropic success that will most likely be her strongest and
              longest lasting legacy.

            <div class="article">
              According to statistics, Pakistan has the second lowest literacy
              rate in the world. Living conditions are harsh and struggling
              parents often choose to send their children to work the fields as
              soon as they are able instead of investing in schooling. As a
              result, 25 million children lack even the most basic education. To
              combat this, Aziz formed CARE (Cooperation for Advancement,
              Rehabilitation, and Education). Although it was a small start with
              only 250 students, it now has nearly 200,000 students.

            <div class="article">
              By building and running its own schools, CARE faces operational
              challenges every day. Despite these, education is on the rise and
              CARE alumni are even going on to prestigious medical schools and
              Aziz is ushering in a whole new generation of informed, smart, and
              capable children. In 2016, she was awarded Barclays UK’s Women of
              the Year Award for her contributions to society. With business on
              the rise and CARE aiming to increase their student count to 1
              million, the future is looking bright indeed.
