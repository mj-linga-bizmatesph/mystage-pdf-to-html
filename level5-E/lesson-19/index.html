              People in power need to think differently. Not promise to make a change but to start with trying to be that change.

              For some, the path to philanthropy is born out of a successful business, a wealthy family, or through some other means of financial success and freedom. 
              Yet, for Jillian Haslam, her dedication to philanthropy was born out of first-hand experience. As a young child growing up in India, 
              Jillian had lived in extreme poverty and the only reason she is alive today is because of the kindness of strangers. Philanthropy brought her out of poverty, 
              gave her an education, and literally saved her life.

              Jillian has now become a powerful voice in the world of philanthropy. Her work is funded through royalties generated from her memoir, Indian.English, speaking events, 
              and generous donors. She then uses these funds to find a way to make an immediate impact by identifying problems and formulating effective solutions to 
              combat the issues head on. Her initiatives have resulted in the creation of special needs schools, job-training programs, blood donation drives, and many many more.

              All of her hard work has earned her worldwide recognition and numerous humanitarian awards including the Mother Teresa Memorial Award in 2017. 
              With five charities currently operating under her watch and constant speaking engagements, one might think that Jillian would be too busy to meet the people she helps. 
              Yet, she continues “to do all I can to reach out to those who are in similar situations now that I was in not so long ago.” After all, what goes around comes around.
