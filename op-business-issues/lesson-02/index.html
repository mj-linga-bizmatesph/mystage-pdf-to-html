            Though many companies <span class="b-purple">strive for</span> a more diverse workforce, it is important to note that diversity is more than just a mix of different cultures and visible

              The more the merrier. That’s what I say. Being in an environment that’s too similar isn’t <span class="b-purple">conducive</span> to growth. I’m sure there are many challenges, but
              working with a more diverse team will not only help us grow as a business, but as people. Let’s embrace change and see where it takes us.

              We have a corporate culture to protect. I’m worried that an <span class="b-purple">influx</span> of too many people with too many different values is going to pull our company apart. I
              understand the need for diversity, but I think we need to be very careful about the kind of culture we want to create and the impact it’s going to have.

            Though there are arguments for both sides, any business operating globally requires more than a standard workforce to succeed. By <span class="b-purple">leveraging</span> the skills and
            perspectives of a truly diverse workforce, companies may be able to secure stronger footholds in an unstable global business scene.
