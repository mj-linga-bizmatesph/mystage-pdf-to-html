            Though many companies <span class="b-purple">strive for</span> a more diverse workforce, it is important to note that diversity is more than just a mix of different cultures and visible

            Though there are arguments for both sides, any business operating globally requires more than a standard workforce to succeed. By <span class="b-purple">leveraging</span> the skills and
