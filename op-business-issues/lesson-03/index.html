            Success doesn’t come easy. Being <span class="b-purple">saddled with</span> increasing pressure to perform, meet targets, and remain competitive has pushed people to get things done at any
            cost. Though this sort of culture may be necessary, resulting lapses in moral judgment may end up doing a company more harm than good.

              It’s my job to hit those numbers at any cost. So, I do what needs to be done. Sometimes that means <span class="b-purple">cutting corners</span>, stepping on toes, or reinterpreting the
              rules. Some may be turned off by that, but when the numbers start coming in and everyone gets their bonus, I don’t hear anyone complaining about my methods.

              As soon as we start saying, “It’s okay, just this once,” we’re going to go down a road that is really hard to come back from. We need to really think about the message we are sending to
              our staff and our shareholders. If we need to lie, cheat, or bend the rules to get the results we need, everything we’ve worked so hard to build could
              <span class="b-purple">implode</span>.

            In a results-driven corporate society, integrity and bottom lines are sometimes <span class="b-purple">at odds</span>. Though some may feel that, “The end determines the means,” others
            feel that the path one takes on the road to success will determine how long it lasts.
