            For many businesses, debt is the last thing they’d want to see in a quarterly statement. Being in the red has never been a positive thing. However, these days more and more companies are
            acting on the <span class="b-purple">adage</span> that, “In order to make money, you have to spend money,” even if it’s money you don’t have.

              If we have it, let’s spend it. If we don’t have it, let’s borrow it. We need to jump on this opportunity and take advantage of these negative interest rates. All the companies that we’ve
              looked at have shown growth through aggressive borrowing. It’s time we stopped <span class="b-purple">playing catch-up</span>. Money sitting in the bank at this point is just being
              wasted.

              Call me a traditionalist but how can debt mean anything but bad news? No one wants the insecurity of not having enough money. We have to be responsible to our shareholders and to our
              employees by creating stable, sustainable growth through measured, proven, and dependable means. Piling on debt seems counter to my <span class="b-purple">sensibilities</span>.

            Regardless of what the approach is, growth is essential to the longevity of any business. Though many may debate the stability and risk of strategies incorporating debt, the potential for
            growth and the lure of <span class="b-purple">greener pastures</span> is, for some, worth the risk.
