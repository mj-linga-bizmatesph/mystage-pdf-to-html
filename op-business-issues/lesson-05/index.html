            The decision to go public has enormous impacts on any company. Though large cash injections seem appealing, resulting shifts in corporate culture, changes in reporting procedures, and the
            need to meet investor demands make some wonder if being publicly traded <span class="b-purple">is all it’s cracked up to be</span>.

              This is why we started our business, right? To get to where we are now. Not everyone can make it to the point where an IPO is within reach. Yes, things are going to change, but imagine
              what we can do with the money! No more <span class="b-purple">scrounging for</span> capital and swallowing half-realized dreams because of financial limitations. This is our big break!

              I don’t want us to lose control. I’m afraid that if we go public, we’re going to lose the soul of our company. As soon as we start <span class="b-purple">prioritizing</span> money and
              investors’ needs above our own, we’re going to start looking for short-term solutions to meet targets and lose sight of our vision. Everything is going to be about money…and that’s not
              me.

            Though there are success stories on both sides, there are dangers to both courses of action. Does the money and glamour of a successful IPO outweigh the added pressure, cost, and confines
            of being a public company? All are important points to consider when <span class="b-purple">taking the plunge</span>.
