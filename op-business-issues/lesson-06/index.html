              Look, it’s simple. If we keep basing what we create on consumer demands and market research, we won’t be able to come up with anything <span class="b-purple">game-changing</span>. People

            always on the lookout for the next big thing. Whatever path companies choose, most can agree that risk and reward often go hand in hand.
