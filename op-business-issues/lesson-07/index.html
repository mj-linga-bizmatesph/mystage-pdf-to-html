            Though many of us understand the value of hard work, some have placed so much emphasis on office life that it severely impacts physical and mental health. Though efforts have been made to
            improve the issue, many would agree that current measures are not enough.

              It’s not just an issue of being overworked, it’s a corporate culture issue, and an <span class="b-purple">apparent</span> issue that <span class="b-purple">plagues</span> the entire
              country as a whole. No one is shying away from hard work, but we’re at the point where it’s starting to feel like slavery. My work consumes everything, and I don’t think the higher-ups
              care. All they look at is the bottom line.

              If you are an efficient worker, able to prioritize without <span class="b-purple">overcommitting</span>, and a good communicator, you should be able to strike a balance. Problems happen
              when people take on too much and are afraid to say no. I get it; no one wants to be viewed as incapable, but better to know your limits than tear yourself apart. No one wins that way.

            Being hardworking at one’s job is a <span class="b-purple">highly sought-after</span> trait. However, desirable as it may be, there is wisdom in the expression, “too much of a good thing
            is bad.” Efforts must be made by both parties to ensure that health and happiness are just as important as business results.
