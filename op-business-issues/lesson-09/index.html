            In certain business cultures, <span class="b-purple">conformity</span> and unity are valued above all else. Although a certain level of efficiency, harmony, and progress may be achieved
            through such means, the resulting lack of varying opinions and viewpoints may end up doing a company more harm than good.

              The last thing we need is <span class="b-purple">discord</span> among the staff. If everyone had an opinion about something, it would take forever for anything to get done. We need to
              streamline our processes and focus on efficiency. It’s our job to make the decisions and everyone else’s job to follow orders. It’s the yes-men that’ll get things done.

              We shouldn’t be looking at our staff like army ants. People want to be heard. If we want to improve employee morale, loyalty, and dedication to the company, we need to let them know that
              their opinions are valued. Even if their ideas <span class="b-purple">go against the grain</span>, this is a good chance for us to get some fresh perspectives.

            How to best utilize one’s workforce is a problem that many companies face. Though employees are expected to follow orders and finish tasks without
            <span class="b-purple">disrupting</span> processes, many would agree that success depends on more than the ability to do as one is told.
