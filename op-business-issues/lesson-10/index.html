            Most of us spend the majority of our waking hours at the office or <span class="b-purple">engaged in</span> professional pursuits. It is no wonder then that so much of our happiness is
            determined by our working conditions, colleagues, and tasks. Though many companies work hard to improve conditions, not all are successful.

              The only thing keeping me here is the money. I’m seriously up to here with everything else. The people I work with are fine, but management needs a serious
              <span class="b-purple">wake-up call</span>. As soon as I can find a new job, I’m out of here. There’s a lot more to being happy than money. It’d be wise for the company to see that.

              It’s not all sunshine and rainbows. The work is hard and the hours are long, but I feel that my <span class="b-purple">contributions</span> really matter, and I can take pride in my
              work. Even though we’re a big business, I feel the company really sees me as a person. The people are great and there’s a real sense of community here. I’m tired after a long day, but
              it’s the good kind of tired.

            Job satisfaction can be an <span class="b-purple">elusive</span> thing. Some value earnings over community, whereas others place camaraderie over professional growth. Whatever it is,
            company morale is worth significant consideration and investment. After all, happiness and productivity have proven to be closely linked.
