            In high-pressure work environments where performance and results are valued, it is not uncommon for rivalries to form. Although friendly competition can be very motivating, too much can
            cause deep, irreparable <span class="b-purple">rifts</span> that only result in hard feelings and a fractured team.

              I’m a competitive person. I’m not afraid to say that. I want to be the best and I’ll do whatever it takes. Joe is good at what he does, but I know I’m better. If getting to the top means
              having to <span class="b-purple">spill blood</span>, I’ll do it. I know people think that it’s better to have friends than enemies, but there’s nothing more motivating than a great
              rival.

              A little friendly competition never hurt anyone, but there’s one thing we can’t forget; we’re a team. We pull together, help each other, and motivate one another. I have little respect
              for those that get to the top at the expense of others. If you want a rival, look outwards, not inwards. The last thing we need on the team is a <span class="b-purple">lone wolf</span>.

          <div class="article">
            Many would agree that ambition is necessary for success. For those at the top, being second best was never an option. Yet, no one gets very far in life without support from others. As a
            result, knowing when to push, when to pull, and the difference between friend and <span class="b-purple">foe</span> is perhaps more important.
