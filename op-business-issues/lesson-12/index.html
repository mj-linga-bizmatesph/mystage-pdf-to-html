            Power can be an <span class="b-purple">addictive</span> and dangerous thing. The feeling of control and authority can lead managers and executives down a dark path that results in low
            employee morale, reduced productivity, and even legal consequences.

              My “boss” often orders me to do the most mundane things that just end up wasting my time. “Make me a reservation,” “Take this to the post office,” “Get me a coffee.” When I ask why, she
              responds with, “I’m the boss, so just do it.” It’s incredibly frustrating. Yeah, I get it. She’s the boss, but I’m not a <span class="b-purple">gopher</span>.

              My supervisor keeps <span class="b-purple">berating</span> the staff in front of others, and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable. I want to say something, but I’m not sure who I should
              talk to. No one wants to be treated like a child, and that’s no way to motivate your staff. He’s not a bad guy, but I don’t think he realizes how demoralizing it is. He wasn’t this way

            Managing a group of people is no easy task. There are times when one may be expected to <span class="b-purple">crack the whip</span> when things are not going to plan. Although the abuse
            of power may be an easy trap to fall into, some would say that one’s true nature, good or bad, is revealed when given a position of power.
