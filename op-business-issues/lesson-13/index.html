            More and more companies are switching from seniority-based incentives to more aggressive, performance-based evaluations. Though both have their merits and demerits, many feel that hard
            work demands equal <span class="b-purple">remuneration</span> and recognition, regardless of age, seniority, or tradition.

              hold them to certain performance standards. Position as a result of seniority has never been efficient. Respectfully, we need to prioritize progress and efficiency over seniority.
