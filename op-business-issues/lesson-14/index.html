            There may be a time when a company must decide how best to replace a retiring executive. Though internal promotions provide most with a sense of ease, certain aspects of a business can
            only be improved through a pair of <span class="b-purple">fresh eyes</span>.

              This is a family business. It has always been a family business, and it will always remain a family business. No one knows this business like we do, and if we start relying on the “<span

                >expertise</span
              >” of others, it won’t be long before we lose control of everything. It takes more than just a good resume to be an executive; it takes trust. Years of it.

              We need <span class="b-purple">a fresh take</span> on things. We’ve been okay so far, but I fear we lack something very important: innovation. Now is the chance to reinvent ourselves, to
              take the business in a bold new direction. It won’t be easy and there will be changes, but we need to stop thinking of change as a bad thing.

            <span class="b-purple">Naming anyone to a position</span> of power can have significant impact. Though there are many things that determine if one is suited to the role or not, it is an
            irrefutable fact that support and trust from other executives and staff are just as important as one’s skills, abilities, and experience.
