            There are times when one’s professional duties extend outside the office and past regular working hours. In order to develop closer working relationships, staff may be
            <span class="b-purple">obliged</span> to have the occasional drink or dinner after work. Although some enjoy such outings, others see it as just more work.

              I burn so much of my energy at the office already. I can’t be bothered to spend my evenings with the people I already see for 10 hours a day, 5 days a week. I get the importance of
              building working relationships, but I can just do that at the office. I don’t need beer and food to build teamwork and <span class="b-purple">camaraderie</span>.

              We had such a great time last night! We’ve got such a great group, and it’s good <span class="b-purple">to let our hair down</span> once in a while. Did you know that Emma is an amazing
              singer? You’d never know it by looking at her, but she’s got a great voice. It’s always so good to see what people are like outside the office. It really gives me a fresh perspective on
              the team.

            Though some may view socializing with colleagues as a <span class="b-purple">hassle</span>, teams that value their co-workers as more than just 9 to 5 relationships may perform better than
            those that don’t. After all, many would agree that business success is more than professional ability; it’s about successful relationships.
