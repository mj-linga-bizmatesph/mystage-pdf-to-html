            In an ever-expanding globalized world, it is essential for companies to compete effectively overseas. Though there are many hurdles to overcome, <span class="b-purple">chief</span> among

              I have to transfer overseas for an assignment, but to be honest, I don’t think I <span class="b-purple">have what it takes</span>. I just don’t have any interest in anything outside my

              <span class="b-purple">to cut it</span> anymore. We’ve been doing the same thing for years on end, but I just don’t see any big improvements. We need to take a different approach.

            It can be said that being successful in global business means more than just knowing the language. It’s about cultural adaptability, sensitivity, and a receptive mind. Though language
            fluency may be essential, it takes more than a few <span class="b-purple">fancy</span> words to be effective in the international business scene.
