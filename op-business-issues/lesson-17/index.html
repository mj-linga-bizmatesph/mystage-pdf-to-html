            Stressed employees, long working hours, and a <span class="b-purple">myriad</span> of other distractions has led to noticeable decreases in workplace productivity. Although there are many

            Though there are no easy answers to increasing productivity, focusing less on generic, corporate-<span class="b-purple">mandated</span> KPIs and more on individual needs may be a step in
            the right direction. Whatever the case, employee performance is often an indicator of a company’s ability to motivate, inspire, and support.
