            As businesses grow and processes become more and more complex, the <span class="b-purple">inevitable</span> question of whether to outsource or find a way to internalize certain tasks
            comes up. Though there are benefits to increasing company know-how, some things are best left to other industry professionals.

              I’m all for getting things done on our own. Yes, it might take time and there will be some <span class="b-purple">growing pains</span>, but in the end, we’ll be better off. There are
              dangers to relying too much on others, and I think we should develop a strong internal culture of self-reliance and improvement. It’ll benefit us in the long run.

              As talented and as smart as we are, there are some things that we just are not equipped to handle. The humility to recognize our <span class="b-purple">shortcomings</span> is going to
              save us a lot of headaches. Plus, this is a really great opportunity for us to build relationships with other companies and businesses. Sometimes we all need a little help.

            When it comes to business, nothing survives in isolation, yet an overdependence on outsourcing may result in <span class="b-purple">stunted</span> internal growth. Though there are solid
            arguments on both sides, many would agree that the best approach is often a balanced one.
