            With lifetime employment becoming less and less attractive for young talent, employee retention can be a serious <span class="b-purple">thorn in management’s side</span>. Although there
            are many issues that impact retention, it’s always important to remember that, “brains, like hearts, go where they are appreciated.”

              I used to think that finding a big company to work in and staying there my whole life was a good thing. Now, I’m not so sure. A lot of companies are willing to
              <span class="b-purple">pay top dollar</span> for good people, and staying here to play the long game just seems like I’m wasting my time. Considering my age and experience, I should
              consider looking elsewhere.

              We need to make sure we protect our assets. By that, I mean our people. We lost three excellent employees over the last two months alone, citing better opportunities. All that training
              and development, <span class="b-purple">down the drain</span>. Offering standard market rates and progression isn’t enough. Loyalty doesn’t come cheap. We get what we pay for.

            Employees look at many things when considering how long to remain with any particular organization. Pay, benefits, and job satisfaction are but just a few. Although many companies
            concentrate on recruiting, failure to focus on retention will make any expansion efforts a lot like <span class="b-purple">paddling upstream</span>.
