              It’s always a good idea to do some research on the business
              culture of the place you are visiting. By learning their way of
              business, you are less likely to encounter misunderstandings.

                Ryo, I’ve heard you’re going to visit a distributor in the U.S.
                Is it your first time there?

                Yes, it is. I’ve been to several Asian countries on business but
                never to the U.S. I think Americans are very informal and
                friendly, so I plan to dress casually.

                I would be careful of that. That really depends on the industry
                and the area within the US. You’re going to the East Coast and
                this is your first meeting with them, so I would wear a suit.
                Americans are usually very friendly, but they are also very
                professional and business-like.

                I see. What do you think is a good gift for them? I usually give
                Japanese wine to my Asian clients.

                The practice of gift-giving is not common in the U.S. and could
                be misinterpreted as trying to bribe them. So, I would avoid any
                gifts.

                Oh really? But if we go drinking after our meeting, the client
                will probably pay for me, so shouldn’t I have something prepared
                for them?

                First of all, it’s not likely that they will ask you out. And if
                they do, they’ll probably expect to go Dutch, which means to
                split the bill.
