              Another important part of the preparation process is to research the day-to-day life of your destination, such as the laws, safety hazards, transportation, general prices, and emergency
              contacts. Doing your research beforehand will save you a lot of stress and ensure a safe return.

                Well, you can use a credit card just about anywhere in the U.S., but I would be careful of using a credit card in small shops. There’s a risk of it being copied. At the same time,
                carrying a lot of cash could make you a target for muggers.

                It would be a good idea to make photocopies of credit cards, your passport, driver’s license, and any other ID. Also, you should have an emergency contact number, just in case you need
                help. I don’t mean to scare you, but Japan is just so safe compared to other parts of the world.

              Imagine that you are scheduled to take a business trip overseas. However, your boss is worried that you are unprepared for the trip. Have a meeting with your boss to explain what you
              know about the day-to-day life of the country you will be visiting.
