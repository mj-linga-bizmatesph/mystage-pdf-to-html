                That’s a good question. Our secret is in our design process. We
                have a system that collects all good design practices into a
                database that covers everything from coding guidelines to
                testability. This database is accessible by all of our design
                engineers and is constantly upgraded as new developments are
                found. So, we have a system that continuously creates high
                quality products. Does that answer your question?
