              As we become more aware of our own culture and the culture of
              others, we begin to understand clear differences in the way people
              think and act. This is a sign of an improvement in cultural
              awareness. However, we can further our understanding by:

                  That’s great. Well, let me tell you about the degrees of
                  cultural awareness. You see, at the first stage, people think
                  that their way is the only way of doing things.

                  Right. At the second stage, people understand there are
                  different ways, but they still feel that their way is the
                  best.

                  I have grown past that way of thinking. I know sometimes other

                  Good, but that’s still just the third stage. At the fourth and
                  final stage, we are willing to create new ways of doing things

                  Good question. We need to understand that global business is a
                  complex process and that there is no one way to approach a
                  problem. Just by accepting this, you’ve opened up the
