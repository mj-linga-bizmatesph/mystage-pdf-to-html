              However, we also mustn’t forget that each person is unique, and
              how one thinks and acts are influenced by many other factors.
              “Individual cultural identity” is who each of us really is. To
              understand this concept:

                  No, it’s absolutely necessary. National culture has a big
                  impact on how we think and act. However, there are many other
                  factors that affect us. Age, your hometown, education, wealth,
                  parents, experiences, and so on, all have an impact, and
                  they’re constantly developing. Think about how these have
                  affected you as a person.
