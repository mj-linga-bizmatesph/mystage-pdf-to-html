              One practical technique in dealing with cultural differences is to “do as the Romans do” - or style switching. It means adjusting your style to meet theirs. Switch styles by:

                  Well, there’s more to it than that. This technique is called style switching. First, you should find out how things are done in that culture and why. You can just ask, “<span
                    class="underline"
                    >I’ve noticed that people tend to … Why is that?</span
                  >”
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="speaker">Ken:</td>
                <td class="speaker-text">I see. So I can just learn and copy.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="speaker">Ron:</td>
                <td class="speaker-text">
                  Before you switch styles, you should confirm if you understand it. So you can give an example by saying, “<span class="underline"
                    >So if I wanted to…, would it be appropriate to…?</span
                  >”
                </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="speaker">Ken:</td>
                <td class="speaker-text">OK, I understand the concept of style switching, but I don’t want to lose my own identity.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td class="speaker">Ron:</td>
                <td class="speaker-text">
                  It’s not necessary to switch styles for everything. And when you do switch styles, just imagine that you have a little button on your shoulder that you push that allows you to change
                  styles for that moment.
