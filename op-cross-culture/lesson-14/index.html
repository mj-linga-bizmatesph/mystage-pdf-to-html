              When a team is made up of a mix of different cultures,
              communication can be extremely difficult. However, a solution to
              this is to create your own team rules. You can do this by:
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              Acknowledging to the team that there are the different ways of
              doing things
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              Agreeing on some rules for everyone to follow
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              Always referring to the rules when needed
            </div>

                  say anything. I didn’t have any control.
