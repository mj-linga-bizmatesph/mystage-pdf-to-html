                  Good question. First, you need to adjust your tone depending on the person. Your tone of voice, gestures, and facial reaction all have some effect. However, your word choice is
                  important, too.

                  That’s OK. You can simply use upgraders to make your message sound more direct. For example, instead of saying, “I need it by Monday”, you can say, “<span class="underline"
                    >I ABSOLUTELY need it by Monday.</span
                  >” Instead of, “It might be difficult for me to attend,” you can say, “<span class="underline">There’s NO WAY I can attend.</span>”

              <tr>
                <td class="speaker">Ken:</td>

              </tr>
              <tr>

                <td class="speaker-text">
                  You can use downgraders. So instead of saying, “You must change it,” you can say, “<span class="underline">MAYBE it’s best to change it.</span>” Instead of, “That’s a bad idea,” you
                  can say, “<span class="underline">It MIGHT BE DIFFICULT to...</span>”
