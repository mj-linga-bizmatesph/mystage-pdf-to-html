              Different cultures have different processes for making decisions.
              Some require a group consensus, while others leave it up to the
              boss to decide. However, when managing a global team, it helps to
              decide the process before making a decision. You can do this by:

                  Ron, I had a really unusual experience with my team the other

                  with our project. However, the following week, two of my team
                  members completely changed their minds.
