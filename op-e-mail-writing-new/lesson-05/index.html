              The KISS rule or Keeping It Short and Simple allows the reader to spend as little time as possible to read and respond to e-mails. To keep it short and simple:
            </div>
            <br />
            <ul class="arrow-part-list">
              <li>
                Use short sentences and short paragraphs
              </li>
              <li>
                Use lists rather than long text
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid unnecessary pair words
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid using idioms with multiple words

                  I really appreciate your volunteering to give me a hand preparing our meeting even though I know it’s a busy and hectic time for you. All I need is help with the room as I’ve taken care of the agenda and the invitations. So, it’d be great and a big help if you could set up Room A. We’re expecting somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 people. They’ll also need to have copies of the handout so could I ask you to print those out for me too? And one last thing, we might need the projector (one of the managers mentioned having slides for his presentation), so could you set that up too? 
                </p>
