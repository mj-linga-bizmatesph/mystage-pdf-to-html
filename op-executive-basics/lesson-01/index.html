                    We manufacture timepieces such as watches and clocks. My
                    company belongs to the watch industry. The first watch was
                    made over 500 years ago. <u>In the past</u>, people wore
                    watches to tell time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, <u>nowadays</u>, many people wear watches for
                    different purposes. People use watches to tell time, for
                    fashion, and for status. So, a watch is not just a tool to
                    tell time, but it is jewelry and a status symbol. And there
                    is a huge market in Japan. <u>In the future</u>, technology
                    will become more and more advanced in our industry. Watches
                    will become multi-functional, like the cell phone. So, we
                    must become more high-tech.
