                    Our company has a wide customer base in Japan.
                    <u>We have two main customer groups</u>. First is
                    corporations. <u>Corporations consist of</u> offices,
                    factories, and other business facilities.
                    <u>For example</u>, PL Plastics uses our clocks in all of
                    their factories and offices.

                    The second group is consumers. They are mostly businessmen
                    in their 30s and 40s. They like quality products but cannot
                    buy a luxury watch. For example, many young managers at my
                    company are fans of our products.
