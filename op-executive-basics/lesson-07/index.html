                    <u>Our industry can be divided into three main groups</u>:
                    affordable casual watches, mid-range business watches, and
                    high-end luxury watches. Although Synchron competes in all
                    three markets, our strength is in the mid-range business
                    watches. <u>There are 4 major</u> watch manufacturers in the
                    mid-range market.

                    our watches offer additional features. All our watches are
                    handmade so they are of very high quality. Although we have
                    less brand awareness than the other three companies, we are
                    viewed as a watch for serious collectors.
