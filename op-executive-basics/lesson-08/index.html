                    <u>One of the key qualities we look for</u> in our applicants is passion for our business. We sell more than just a tool to tell time. We are experts in our industry. A quality
                    that I personally look for in applicants is how detailed they are. We are a watch company, so our people need to be very organized and meticulous.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <u>We have a very strict hiring process</u>. The first step is our written test where we check for general knowledge. Then we have small group interviews to get an idea of each
                    applicant’s personality type and communication skills. Next, we have individual interviews and finally, the president’s interview. Each year, we get over 2000 applicants.
                    <u>Synchron is a stable company showing good business growth</u>, which makes us appealing to new grads.
