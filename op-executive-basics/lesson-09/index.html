              A company is a group of people together with a shared objective.
              The type of people you have makes your company unique. Explain

                    <u>We have a total of</u> 4000 employees. About half of them
                    work in manufacturing plants while the other half work at
                    our head office, sales offices, and research centers. We
                    also have 200 based overseas in our foreign branch offices.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <u>Our workforce is made up of</u> about 75% men because we
                    are a watch manufacturer for men. However, we have many
                    women in marketing, design, and admin positions. Many of our
                    sales staff and engineers are men in their mid 30s to late
                    40s. <u>In order to become more global</u>, we have started
                    hiring foreigners, especially from China. So I hope to see a
                    more diverse workforce in the next few years.
