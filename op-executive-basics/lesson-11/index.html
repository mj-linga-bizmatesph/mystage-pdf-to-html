                    I think Synchron Corp. has a lot of strong points.
                    <u>One of our strengths is</u> innovation. We constantly
                    come up with new and unique ideas. <u>In fact,</u> we have
                    been awarded as the “Innovator of the year” 2 years ago. We
                    were featured in many magazines.
                    <u>This helped our brand become more popular.</u>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <u>Another strong point is</u> our pricing. Our products are
                    very affordable. <u>In fact,</u> we’re priced 20% less than
                    our competitors. <u>This has led to our</u> X1 model being
                    named the most popular watch in our area.
