              All companies have weaknesses. What’s important is how you plan to
              improve them. Discuss your weaknesses confidently by using the

                    Our company also has areas for improvement.
                    <u>We need to improve</u> our incentive system. Many of our
                    sales reps leave the company because of this.
                    <u>Our plan is to</u> place more funds in our incentive
                    scheme. <u>We hope this will</u> reduce the number of sales
                    reps leaving the company next year.

                    However, I think our greatest weakness is our limited
                    market. <u>We need to improve</u> our presence in the global
                    market. <u>Our plan is to</u> change our mindset. I think we
                    can do this by reminding everyone about the corporate
                    vision. <u>We hope this will</u> open more opportunities in
                    the near future.
