                    I think more and more people are getting into retro-style
                    fashion. It’s easy to find women’s accessories.
                    <u>The problem is, there aren’t</u> too many retro-style
                    accessories for men, especially watches. You can find some
                    online, but they can be expensive.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <u>So, to solve this</u>, we will bring back the
                    old-fashioned pocket watch. It will have the same gentleman
                    look, but built with modern technology.
                    <u>Our target market will be</u>
                    businessmen who want to look more mature. I think this will
                    help us enter the global market.
