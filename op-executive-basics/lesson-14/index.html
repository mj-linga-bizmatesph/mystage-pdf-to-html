                    <u>One of the biggest challenges we are facing is</u> mobile
                    technology. Almost everyone uses a smart phone. And all
                    these smart phones have built-in clocks. Who needs a watch
                    when you have a phone? I think this idea appeals mostly to
                    younger generations.

                  <p>
                    <u>This could greatly impact</u> our sales and the industry
                    in the future. <u>So, my idea is to</u> partner with mobile
                    phone manufacturers. We can develop smart watches that are
                    compatible with any mobile phone. People who couldn’t access
                    their phones at work or at school would find these watches
                    useful.
