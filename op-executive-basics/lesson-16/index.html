                    employees. <u>So, we give out incentives</u> to sales reps
                    who exceed their monthly targets and publish their photos in
                    our company newsletter. Because of this,
                    <u>our sales reps have become</u> much more determined to
                    meet their goals.

                    <u>We also want our employees to</u> suggest new ideas to
                    top management. <u>So, we ask all employees to</u> submit at
                    least 1 new idea every week and give a cash prize to the
                    employee with the best idea.
                    <u>This system has helped us</u> implement many new
                    programs.
