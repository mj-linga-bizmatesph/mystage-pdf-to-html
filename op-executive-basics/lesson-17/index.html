                    <u>There was one time when</u> a foreign customer went to
                    our store to buy a men’s watch. A few days later we received
                    an email saying he bought an item with a factory defect.
                    That was the first time it happened after many years. We
                    apologized and asked him to return the item so we can check
                    it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    It really was a factory defect, so we replaced the item.
                    <u>On top of that</u>, we also gave him a matching women’s
                    watch as a gift for his wife.
                    <u>In the end, the customer was</u> very thankful. We found
                    out he has a YouTube channel doing product reviews. He gave
                    our product and our customer support some really good
                    feedback.
