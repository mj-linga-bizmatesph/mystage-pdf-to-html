                    I have over 300 employees in my division in 3 different
                    locations. So, it’s impossible for me to communicate
                    one-on-one with all members. However,
                    <u>I think it’s important for everyone to</u> know what I am
                    thinking about all the time.

                  <p>
                    <u>So, I try to</u> send my message out every time to my
                    staff. I have a daily online journal to share what I’m
                    doing. I have weekly meetings with our managers. And I visit
                    each office at least once a week and talk to some staff.
                    <u>As a result</u>, everyone feels they can trust me.
