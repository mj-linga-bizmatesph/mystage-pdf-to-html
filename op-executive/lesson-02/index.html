                During an interview with the media, you may find an opportunity
                to emphasize an important but often-misunderstood concept in
                your business. This is a great opportunity to reinforce your
                message. You can do this by:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Mentioning what the misunderstanding is at the beginning
                </li>
                <li>Explaining the important business concept</li>
                <li>
                  Making sure the reporter believes that it is indeed a
                  misunderstanding
