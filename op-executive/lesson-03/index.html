                Sometimes it’s difficult to really understand the reporter’s
                question. The reporter may be speaking too fast or using a
                difficult idiom you don’t know. Whatever the reason, it’s
                important that you clarify the question before you answer. You
                can do this by:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Asking to repeat the question more slowly</li>
                <li>Asking to rephrase the question</li>
                <li>Confirming the meaning of the question</li>

            Ken, an executive director, is being interviewed by a reporter about

              We all realize that globalization is inevitable. Not just to
              survive, but in order to thrive. Top management has done its best
              to communicate this company-wide. Therefore, many of our employees
              have made learning English a priority. I can’t say that everyone
              in our company will be using English in their work, but I can say
              that everyone will need to have a global mind.
