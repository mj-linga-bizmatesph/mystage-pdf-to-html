                An effective technique to get your point across is to start with a general statement which sums up your opinion and then move into specifics to support it. You can do this by:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Starting with a general statement to sum up your opinion</li>
                <li>Going into specifics about your company</li>
                <li>Once again making a general statement to summarize your opinion at the end</li>

              <u>“Entrepreneurial spirit” is not a term used only by start-ups</u>. It’s a mindset that needs to be embraced by all employees no matter how big or small the company is. As our business
              environment changes so rapidly, opportunities for new business ideas are all around us. <u>So, at Synchron, we encourage our employees to</u> take calculated risks, and make them into
              feasible businesses. So, although we are a large corporation with a long history, our employees understand that entrepreneurship equals business growth.
              <u>And this is something all businesses need</u>.
