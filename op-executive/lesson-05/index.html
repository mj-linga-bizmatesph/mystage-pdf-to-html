              OK. Well, at Synchron, we look for employees who show strong potential to become effective leaders and do our best to develop them. And based on my experience, they’re not always the
              ones who perform the best on their own. We look for people skills, ambition, and focus, as these are traits that are difficult to teach. Then, we give them every opportunity to
              experience various areas and positions in our business.
              <u>Anyway, I’ll have our HR director give you more information on our program</u>.
