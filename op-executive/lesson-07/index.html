                Although your interview with a reporter should be professional, it helps to become a bit personable sometimes to build a closer bond. You can become friendlier by:

                <li>Using the reporter’s name</li>

              <u>Thank you for saying so, Jim</u>. <u>Actually, you look like you go to the gym every day</u>. <u>What do you do to stay in shape</u>? But all kidding aside, health is a major concern
              for the company and all our executives. Many of us are in our 50s and up, and if any of us got a sudden illness, it could severely impact our business. So over the last few years, our
              company has tried to create a culture of healthy living. Simple changes, such as adding fruit or vegetable snacks in the office, closing the office early on Wednesdays, and holding
              monthly outdoor events have greatly raised the awareness of wellness in our company.
