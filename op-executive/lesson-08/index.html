                An effective way to make your answer interactive and interesting
                is to tell it in a story. This makes it easier for you to add a
                dramatic effect and to connect better with the reporter. You can
                do this by:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Giving a brief background of the situation</li>
                <li>Speaking in the narrative form</li>
                <li>
                  Relating the conclusion of the story to the original question
                </li>

              Honestly speaking, I didn’t always pay much attention to building
              a social network. Until about 10 years ago, I would turn down
              dinner invitations from business partners.
              <u>Then, one day, a sudden downturn in our business</u> led to
              major restructuring that left me jobless for 6 months until an old
              business contact, Tom, offered to introduce me to the HR Director
              at Synchron. And so, I said, “Sure, why not?”. And that’s how I
              got in Synchron. So, now, I spend some time each week keeping in
              touch with my contacts.
