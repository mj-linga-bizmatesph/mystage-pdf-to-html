                Sometimes, your answers can get a bit long and it may be unclear
                to the reporter what your point is. So, you can wrap up your
                response at the end to ensure there is no misunderstanding. You
                can do this by:

              <u>What we look for has definitely changed over the years</u>. We
              don’t see the point of hiring people based on technical skills as
              we did before. We place more emphasis on personality traits. One
              is adaptability. We are constantly changing our processes and our
              people need to adjust. So willingness to learn is another
              essential quality. Due to the speed of technological advances,
              many of the technical skills that we need today will become
              irrelevant tomorrow. And finally, creativity. New ideas don’t come
              from robots. They come from people. So that’s an important
              quality.

              adaptability, willingness to learn, and creativity.
