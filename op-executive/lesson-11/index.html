                One way to give impact to your answer is to make an analogy or a comparison of your idea with something more common. This will not only emphasize your answer but also make your answer
                easier to understand. You can do this by:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Explaining your idea</li>
                <li>Making your analogy</li>
                <li>Making sure your analogy is understood if needed</li>

              Technology has had a huge impact on our industry.
              <u>And the change has come so suddenly that it’s wiped out many of our competitors that could not adapt</u>.
              <u>Much like how the dinosaurs went extinct, technology is that giant meteor</u>. Luckily for us, we got started very early to move towards digitization by going paperless and
              internalizing our IT functions. Moreover, our products have become very tech-oriented as well. However, we also need to be careful not to allow technology to overrun the company. We need
              to remember that our ideas come first, and technology supports them; not the other way around.
