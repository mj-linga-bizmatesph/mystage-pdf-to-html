              Less than 2% of your workforce is non-Japanese and less than 10%

              OK, they probably are correct.
              <u>However, your assumption isn’t</u>. You see, at Synchron,
              diversity is more than just a mix of nationalities and gender.
              It’s a wide mix of people with different values and backgrounds.

                industries</u
              >. We also have a wide range of age groups in our workforce.
              Finally, over the last three years, we’ve tripled the number of
              non-Japanese hires and plan to increase this over the next five
              years.
