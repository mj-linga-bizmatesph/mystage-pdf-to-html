                Another way to support your views is to use quotes of famous people. If your opinion is supported by something a well-respected business leader has said, it gives your answer more
                credibility. You can do this by:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Expressing your views</li>

              Based on the products that these companies have released, we do not see them as a threat.
              <u>They have not shown any originality at all</u>. They have basically copied our products and priced themselves lower.
              <u>As Disney once said, “We can innovate faster than our competitors can imitate.”</u>
              <u>Our products are technically far superior than our competitors’ products</u>, and I believe the market can see the difference.
