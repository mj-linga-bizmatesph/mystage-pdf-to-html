                You certainly can’t be expected to have the answer to every question. The last thing you want to do is give out false information to a reporter. So, don’t be pressured to answer a
                question if you don’t know the answer. You can always get back to the reporter later. You can do this by:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Telling the reporter you don’t know the answer</li>
                <li>Asking if it’s OK to get back to him or her later</li>
                <li>Making sure that you actually get back to the reporter</li>
              </ul>

              Many people say that it’s human nature to resist change. However, I don’t think this is true. I think it’s not knowing the impact of the change that causes resistance rather than the
              change itself. So as an executive, it’s my job to communicate the reason and impact as clearly as I can.
