                Applicants apply to many companies without really doing much research on the company. So it's a good idea to find out if the applicant really wants to join your company or if the
                applicant is just looking for any job. Here are some questions you can ask:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Why are you interested in our company?</li>
                <li>What do you know about our company?</li>
                <li>How do we compare to our competitors?</li>
