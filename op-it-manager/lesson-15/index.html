              Some foreign workers need time to get accustomed to the local work
              culture. So, when bringing up a concern, show them you understand
              their situation. You can do this by:

                  Sure. I had the flu for a couple of days, so I missed a few
                  meetings. But it’s not my fault. I have no control over these

                  I understand. But Hiro needs to make sure that each member
                  reports progress and communicates it to the team.

                  Well, I guess I could email him my progress, and he could

                  Right. So, that would allow the team to move forward without
                  waiting for you to return.
