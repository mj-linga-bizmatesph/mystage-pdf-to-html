                It’s one thing to <u>know</u> that you are a perfect match. It’s
                another thing to <u>show</u> that you are. Don’t leave it up to
                the interviewer to decide. Make the decision for them by showing
                what you can do for their company.

                  Well, a close friend mentioned some major changes in your
                  industry, including digitalization and overseas expansion. He
                  explained a lack of online marketing was a big challenge for
                  domestic companies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And this was very similar to my experience where I headed the
                  marketing side of our expansion in Asia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, when I explained to my friend that I wanted to continue
                  working in a global environment, he suggested that I would be
                  a perfect fit for your company’s expansion plans.
