                One of the most effective ways to answer a question is with a story based on your experience. However, the story needs to be relevant to the question and told in a way that is easy to
                follow. Be sure to have 3-5 different stories that you can use to answer various questions.

                Yes, last year our company implemented a new salary system which was not communicated very well to everyone. But the decision was made by the top so there was nothing we could do about
                it.

                  Last year, our company implemented a new salary system. However, many employees thought the system was unfair, including me. As the team leader, it was my responsibility to ensure
                  that my staff were motivated. So I met with the HR Manager to learn the reason for the new system. Once I understood the reasons, I agreed with the new salary system and could
                  confidently explain it to my staff from their perspective. All of them accepted and continued to do their best for the company. And in the end, our team won the top performance
                  award.
