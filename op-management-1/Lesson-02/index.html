              Our company was founded in 1979 by Hajime Suzuki. He was a great
              engineer. In 1998, our company merged with Gateway Digital and
              entered the global market. In 2003, the company was listed on the
              Tokyo Stock Exchange. And since 2010, we have been known as one of
              the biggest data storage companies in Japan.
