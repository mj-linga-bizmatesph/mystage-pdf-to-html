                  I work as a manager in the Shipping Department. My job is to
                  make sure our products are delivered on time. Accuracy and
                  efficiency are very important in my job. I also work closely
                  with the Sales Department. This is important so we can deliver
                  the items with the customer’s exact specifications. If I don’t
                  do my job well, we will receive a lot of complaints.
