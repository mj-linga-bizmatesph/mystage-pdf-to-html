                  Our company provides many training programs. We need to be
                  well-trained to meet our quality standards. Some training
                  programs, like sales and marketing, are for 3 months. However,
                  training for managers could last over a year. My management
                  training program was long and difficult, but I’m glad I took
                  it.
