                  Our typical expenses include office supplies, overtime work,
                  team building, etc. Overtime work is our biggest cost. This is
                  because it is the busy season now. I try to manage this by
                  just having short meetings every week. When we order office
                  supplies, I must approve it. Sometimes I pay when I have
                  dinner with my team.
