                  I meet with my staff twice a year to set their goals. I want
                  their goals to be challenging but still achievable. I give
                  them time to prepare because I want them to think about their
                  goals carefully. At the end of each term, I meet with them
                  individually to check their progress. Then, I give them
                  feedback and advice on their performance.
