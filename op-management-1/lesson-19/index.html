              I joined the company more than 5 years ago. I started working in the Shipping Department. Then, I got promoted to Manager about 2 years ago. I would like to move up to Production and
              apply for the Senior Manager post. It won’t be easy, but I have my boss’ full support. I think I’m ready for the new position so I’ll take the promotion test next year.
