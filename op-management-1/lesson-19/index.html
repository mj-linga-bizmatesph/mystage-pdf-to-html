                  I joined the company more than 5 years ago. I started 
                  working in the Shipping Department. Then, I got promoted to 
                  Manager about 2 years ago. I would like to move up to 
                  Production and apply for the Senior Manager post. It won’t 
                  be easy, but I have my boss’ full support. I think I’m ready for 
                  the new position so I’ll take the promotion test next year.
