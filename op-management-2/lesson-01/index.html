              Good morning, everyone. My name is Taka Suzuki, and I am your new manager. I have lots of experience in MMB Japan, so I can teach you about many things. My expectation is to be number

              Good morning, everyone. <u>I’d like just a few minutes to introduce myself</u>. My name is Taka Suzuki, but please call me Taka. I joined MMB Japan in 1998 and have worked in both QA
              and Sales. I’m married and have two children. I love golf, so I hope I have a chance to play some rounds with you. 
              <br />
              <br />
              This is my first time to work overseas, so I’m very excited to have this opportunity. <u>I’ve heard that we have an excellent team</u> with several experienced salespeople with lots
              of knowledge and new reps with great ideas.
              <br />
              <br />
              For the first week, <u>I’d like to have one-on-one meetings</u> with everyone to hear your ideas. And then, I hope together <u>we can develop a strategy to help us become</u> the
              best sales team in the country. I look forward to doing great work with everyone. Thank you.
