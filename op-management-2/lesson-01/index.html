                  A welcome speech is your chance to make a good impression on your team. 
                  You can answer three questions for your staff:

              Good morning, everyone. My name is Taka Suzuki, 
              and I am your new manager. I have lots of experience in MMB Japan, 
              so I can teach you about many things. My expectation is to be number
              1. So I hope you can help me achieve my dream. Thank you.

              Good morning, everyone. 
              <u>I’d like just a few minutes to introduce myself</u>. 
              My name is Taka Suzuki, but please call me Taka. 
              I joined MMB Japan in 1998 and have worked in both QA
              and Sales. I’m married and have two children. 
              I love golf, so I hope I have a chance to play some rounds with you. 
              <br />
              <br />
              This is my first time to work overseas, 
              so I’m very excited to have this opportunity. 
              <u>I’ve heard that we have an excellent team</u> 
              with several experienced salespeople with lots
              of knowledge and new reps with great ideas.
              <br />
              <br />
              For the first week, 
              <u>I’d like to have one-on-one meetings</u> 
              with everyone to hear your ideas. And then, I hope together 
              <u>we can develop a strategy to help us become</u> the
              best sales team in the country. I look forward to doing great work with everyone.
               Thank you.
