                Oftentimes we get so busy trying to run our day-to-day business. In a fast-paced business setting, people around us aren’t slowing down, so why should we? But sooner or later, we’ll
                realize we’re no longer moving forward
              </p>

                Too much work can take its toll. Take a step back from your work once in a while. It could give you the opportunity to re-assess the issues you are facing and even come up with new
                ideas. Sure, you have lots of work to do. But when you’re mentally drained, you can’t really accomplish that much, can you? Pause for a moment to unwind or to get a broader perspective
                of the situation. Spend some time alone or just chat with someone. The idea is to condition your mind and start out fresh again by taking a step back.

              <p class="instruction">There are many ways to momentarily take your mind off work, but you may start with the tips below:</p>
              <ul class="see-bullets">

                <li>Find someone to talk to – talk to someone about your problem, or just have a friendly chitchat. Ideas sometimes come from unlikely topics</li>
                <li>Compose yourself – focus on the issue once more and draw your solution from the information you got during your short break</li>
              </ul>
