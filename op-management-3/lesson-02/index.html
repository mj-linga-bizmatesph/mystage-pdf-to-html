                Have you ever felt like there just weren’t enough hours in your workday? You certainly aren’t slacking off, but it just seems like your work is never-ending. Well, on a closer look, it
                could very well be that 80% of your output is coming from only 20% of the time spent. At least that’s according to the 80/20 rule.

              <p>
                The 80/20 rule states that, in general, 80% of our output comes from only about 20% of our input. The rest of time, we’re likely to be spending on tasks that add little value to our
                primary objective. Managers are paid, not for the time spent at work, but for the results that they produce. With this in mind, it makes no sense for managers to be doing tasks that
                add very little to the end result.

                However, this is a common problem for many in management positions. So how do we get away from our trivial tasks and increase our productive time? Asking yourself these questions could
                help:
