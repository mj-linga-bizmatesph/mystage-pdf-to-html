                Mark Twain said, “If we were supposed to talk more than we listen, we would have two tongues and one ear.” He has a good point. Yet some leaders think that effective communication
                means talking a lot.

                Good managers know how to talk. The best ones know how to listen. But listening isn’t just about processing information or sitting there quietly. It’s more of letting the other person
                feel they are valued. Listening opens windows of opportunity to better understand the situation and make key decisions based on information. More importantly, this non-verbal skill
                helps us connect with people on a more meaningful and personal level. Leaders who know how to listen will more likely have their team’s loyalty and commitment than managers who don’t.

              <p class="instruction">Here are some tips to show you’re a good listener:</p>
              <ul class="see-bullets">
                <li>Observe – do not over-talk, and watch out for non-verbal cues</li>
                <li>Empathize – respond appropriately and mirror the other person’s emotions</li>
                <li>Check your understanding – ask questions; make sure you understand</li>
              </ul>
