                Goals give us a sense of direction of who or what we want to be. When goals involve other people, it becomes vital for these goals to be comprehensible to everyone involved. And when
                this happens, great things can be accomplished.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, it isn’t enough to just know what your goals are. A truly effective goal includes what, when, how, and by whom. For example, let’s compare two managers: <u>Manager A</u> wants to
                increase his team’s efficiency. On the other hand, <u>Manager B</u> wants to increase his team’s efficiency by 10% in the next three months by completing the easy tasks first to make room for
                the difficult ones later. Both have the same goal, but Manager B has set the team’s objectives clearly.
              </p>
              <p class="instruction">Whether it’s personal or business, the “SMART” way of structuring a clear goal should be:</p>
              <ul class="see-bullets">
                <li><b>Specific</b> – what exactly will we do?</li>
                <li><b>Measurable</b> – how will we track it?</li>
                <li><b>Attainable</b> – is this really possible?</li>
                <li><b>Relevant</b> – is this really important?</li>
                <li><b>Time-bound</b> – when is the deadline?</li>
              </ul>
