                General George Patton once said, “Don't tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results.” It worked in the U.S. Army, and it’ll surely
                work in the office.

                It’s true that certain tasks require us to follow specific procedures. But in most cases, there’s more than one way to get something done and still get the same results. You can show
                someone how to do a complex task once or twice then let him/her explore the possibilities of doing it more efficiently. However, when you always tell people how YOU want it done,
                you’re just limiting their creativity and end up supervising them constantly. Remember, the process that works for you may not work for other people. So allow your staff to discover
                their own way of doing things. By doing so, they learn to work on their own and have more room to grow.
              </p>
              <p class="instruction">Here are some tips when you need your staff to do something:</p>
              <ul class="see-bullets">
                <li><b>Explain the goal</b> – clearly set expectations or desired results</li>
                <li><b>Set controls</b> – clearly define deadline, budget, work hours, etc.</li>
                <li><b>Boost creativity</b> – let your staff think and act independently</li>
                <li><b>Keep your lines open</b> – be available for support</li>
              </ul>
