                In modern business, the presence of diversity is almost always inevitable. Whether you’re part of a global company or a small start-up, you cannot avoid diversity as much as you cannot
                avoid change.
              </p>
              <p>
                People think of diversity as just differences in culture, gender or age. However, diversity has a deeper meaning. It also covers values, skills, experiences, perspective and even
                behavior. Two things can happen when people with different personalities, ideas or backgrounds work together: First is synergy. When diverse individuals collaborate, the results can be
                mind-blowing. Second is conflict. Such diversity can lead to misunderstandings and tear the entire team. As a manager, your role is to harness these differences to work in your favor.
                The idea is to think as individuals but act as one unit towards a common vision.

              <p class="instruction">Here are some tips to help you get the most out of workplace diversity:</p>
              <ul class="see-bullets">
                <li>Know yourself – understand your own culture, stereotypes, biases, etc.</li>
                <li>Don’t discriminate – treat and respect everyone with equality and fairness</li>
                <li>Know your team – understand their strengths and what motivates them individually and collectively</li>
                <li>Encourage diversity – encourage your staff to accept one another’s skills, ideas, experiences through recognition</li>
                <li>Manage conflict – handle conflict among your staff right away when it goes out of control</li>
              </ul>
