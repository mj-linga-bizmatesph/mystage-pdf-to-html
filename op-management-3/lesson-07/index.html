                Giving feedback to an employee whose performance isn’t meeting your expectations is not something that many managers look forward to doing. The reason being, we just don’t know if the
                employee will be receptive or defensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, if we change our perception of giving feedback from “telling the employee what to do” to “finding out what the employee is doing and why”, the approach to giving feedback
                completely changes. Feedback is only useful if the other person is willing to accept it. And the biggest barrier to this is when the manager has already made up in his or her mind what
                the issue is.
              </p>
              <p class="instruction">So to give meaningful feedback that your staff will accept, you can follow these tips:</p>
              <ul class="see-bullets">
                <li>Be positive – focus on the positives to get the other person to listen</li>
                <li>Address any issues – be honest in any concerns or issues</li>
                <li>Understand – ask why the employee is doing something in a certain way</li>
                <li>Agree on solutions– work together to come up with a solution</li>
              </ul>
