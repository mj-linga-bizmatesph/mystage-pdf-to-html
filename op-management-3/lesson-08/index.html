                Any carpenter would tell you that having a well-sharpened tool is essential to successful woodworking. He needs to keep his saw or chisel sharp. Otherwise, his work would be nothing
                more than just glorified firewood.

                Honing your skills is a continual process. The only way to do your job effectively and efficiently is by making sure your skills can keep up with the tasks. However, it’s not just
                about perfecting your competencies but also acquiring new ones relevant to what you need to do. You can learn every skill out there all you want but the question is: Do you really need
                to learn all of them? Sure, they may come in handy in the future, but you would’ve already spent a considerable time learning things that are trivial. So prioritize shaping the skills
                that your job requires. And you can start by knowing your duties as a manager like the back of your hand.
              </p>
              <p class="instruction">Here are some tips to guide you in honing your skills as a manager:</p>
