                As a manager, you have been called to lead and manage a team. However, this doesn’t mean you answer to no one but yourself. Keep in mind that someone higher placed you in this position
                and also expects you to follow.
              </p>
              <p>
                So here you are managing a new project; trying to pull out all the stops to exceed your supervisor’s expectations. There’s nothing wrong about being proactive but the question is: Is
                this exactly what your supervisor wants? Whether it’s a project or an issue, the key is to keep your boss informed of whatever’s happening. Remember, you can see or hear things in
                areas where he doesn’t. Your leadership isn’t the only one that is at stake but also your supervisor’s. You can’t do your job well if you don’t have good followers, can you? Exactly.
                Your boss can’t do his/her job well either without your help.
              </p>
              <p class="instruction">Give what your supervisor wants and do more. Here are some tips:</p>
              <ul class="see-bullets">
                <li>Communicate – keep your boss up-to-date with what’s going on</li>
                <li>Deliver – do your best to complete the task you’ve committed yourself to</li>
                <li>Respect – show disagreement politely and explain your reason clearly</li>
                <li>Come prepared – do some research first then provide the details when bringing up an issue</li>
                <li>Seek advice – ask for help when you’ve exhausted all possible options</li>
              </ul>
