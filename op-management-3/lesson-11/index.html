                The norm. This is how things have always been done and there’s a good reason to follow it. Treading along proven methods has always been safe, but not entirely effective sometimes.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, many people prefer to stay within the “box” or their comfort zone. This is OK, but the problem is you’re only confined to the same set of solutions. When you think out of the
                box, you break away from the standards and possibly come up with a new approach. What do the assembly line, personal computers, or wireless communication have in common? All these came
                about by thinking out of the box and it’s hard to imagine what the business world would be like without them. You can choose to follow the norm and enjoy the security it gives; or you
                can come up with something more effective and have other people benefit from it.

              <p class="instruction">Consider these things when you’re thinking out of the box:</p>
              <ul class="see-bullets">
                <li>Reality – Is the idea too unrealistic?</li>
                <li>Routine – Is the idea similar to what I’ve been doing?</li>
                <li>Resources – Do I have the time, the people, the funds and the technology to do this?</li>
                <li>Result – Will the idea address an issue or improve a process?</li>
              </ul>
