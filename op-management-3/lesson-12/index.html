              <p>Your team is composed of people with different skills, experiences and viewpoints. When managed effectively, this kind of diversity can help you surpass all expectations.</p>
              <p>
                However, such diversity can also lead to conflicts that could break the harmony within the team and impair performance. Sure, some are just petty quarrels that can be ignored, but keep
                in mind that these could end up in a dispute. When this happens, you need to extinguish the flame before it even breaks out. But conflict isn’t all that bad. In fact, it’s a good
                opportunity for your team members to understand and appreciate one another’s viewpoints or actions. It just depends on how you mediate the conflict.
              </p>
              <p class="instruction">The steps below can help you and your team resolve conflict:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Agree to resolve the conflict</b> – everyone involved should acknowledge the conflict and agree to cooperate in resolving it</li>
                <li><b>Analyze the situation</b> – understand what caused the conflict and separate facts from beliefs</li>
                <li><b>Reach an agreement</b> – decide a course of action as a team</li>
                <li><b>Prevention over cure</b> – use the experience to avoid similar conflicts from happening in the future</li>
              </ul>
