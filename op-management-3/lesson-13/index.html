                Change is inevitable. This is especially true in business because without change, there can be no progress. As a manager, it is your role to ensure that this change is carried out.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being an advocate of change isn’t just about effective communication but also personal engagement. People tend to resist change when new systems or processes are just dictated. So
                whether you’re cascading a directive from the CEO or trying to implement your own, it’s important to address “people issues” first. Align your explanation with the organization’s
                vision and your team’s culture.
              </p>
              <p class="instruction">Getting your team to embrace change can be challenging. Here are some tips:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>Be a strong advocate</b> – believe in the benefits of change</li>
                <li><b>Communicate clearly</b> – never assume that everyone sees the change the same way you do</li>
                <li><b>Focus on benefits</b> – emphasize the merits from the transformation</li>
                <li><b>Show empathy</b> – show that you understand your staff’s concerns</li>
                <li><b>Get involvement</b> – create change advocates like you</li>
              </ul>
