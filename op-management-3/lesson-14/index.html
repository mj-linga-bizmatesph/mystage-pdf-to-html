                What could be worse for an employee than having a boss who is always behind closed doors? Employees begin to formulate their own conclusions based on gossip and hearsay. And eventually
                a culture of the-boss-versus-us mentality emerges. However, there is a solution.

                Management by walking around or MBWA is a management approach which is commonly found in offices today. As the name suggests, you just casually walk around the workplace with no
                apparent purpose but to mingle with your team. You’ll be surprised how a few minutes of small talk with your team can do wonders. The idea is to get to know your staff on a personal
                level. More importantly, it gives you the opportunity to see how they work and what their concerns are. You’re not just opening the door of your office to them, but you’re breaking
                down the walls for them.
              </p>
              <p class="instruction">To make this management approach effective, you should:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Make it a routine – MBWA is not just a one-time event; it needs to become a part of your management style</li>
                <li>Talk about different things – vary from business to non-business topics</li>
                <li>Ask for input – this is your chance to gather their feedback or concerns about a particular issue in the workplace</li>
              </ul>
