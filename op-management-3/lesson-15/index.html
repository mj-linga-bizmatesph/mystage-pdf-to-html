                Some say leadership and management are the same. However, some say not all managers are good leaders and not all leaders are good managers. So how do we distinguish one from the other?
              </p>
              <p>
                The main difference is, a manager needs to get things done right, while a leader needs to get the right things done. A manager focuses on work or tasks that need to be carried out by
                his subordinates. He is tasked with managing resources like people, money, time and equipment. On the other hand, a leader focuses on goals that he and his followers must achieve. He
                is tasked with motivating people and fostering good relationships.
