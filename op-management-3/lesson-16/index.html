                Most of us learn things the hard way. Experience is the best teacher we could ever have. We commit mistakes and we learn from them. It’s part of life but it doesn’t mean it can’t be
                avoided.
              </p>
              <p>
                Learning from others can help you in many different ways. From reading books authored by experts to taking professional classes, there is just so much to learn from others. You could
                learn something new from an unfruitful effort, but at the end of the day, you’ve wasted both time and money. In addition, you could avoid mental, physical and emotional stress. Failure
                can teach us something, but in most cases it can be very demotivating.
              </p>
              <p class="instruction">Here are some tips on how we can learn from others:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Gather information – ask questions, engage in conversations, etc.</li>
                <li>Imitate not duplicate – the idea is to follow a model, not to be an exact copy</li>
                <li>Observe – watch and study how the experts are doing it</li>
                <li>Understand what works for you – choose methods that work to your advantage</li>
                <li>Apply what you learned – practice what you learned and make it a part of your everyday life</li>
              </ul>
