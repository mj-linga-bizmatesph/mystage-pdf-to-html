                We all react to certain challenges differently. Some tend to break down and lose hope or ignore the problem altogether, while some go out of their way and look at the issue from a
                different perspective.
              </p>

                When a crisis stares at you right in the face, it’s fairly difficult to remain calm and optimistic. But as they say, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. In other words, view
                your crisis as an opportunity. This could be your ultimate test as a manager. Whenever you see a problem as an opening to improve or develop something, then you’re proving yourself to
                be the right man for the job. Optimism is as contagious as negativity in the workplace. And it all starts with you as the manager.
              </p>
              <p class="instruction">There are lots of ways to stay positive when facing a problem, but here are some helpful tips:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Acknowledge difficulties – the more you understand what the issue is, the better you’re able to handle it</li>
                <li>Orient with reality – stay away from fantasies and stick with practical solutions</li>
                <li>Think long-term – don’t settle for “band-aids” when you can fix the problem permanently</li>
                <li>Take action – apply your optimism and deal with the issue head-on</li>
                <li>Reassure your staff – some words of encouragement can go a long way</li>
              </ul>
