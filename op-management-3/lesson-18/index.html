                The great Chinese philosopher, Lao Tzu, once said, “A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.”

                Not being noticed while contributing to the company’s success seems ironic. So how do you become an “invisible” manager? First let’s define what a visible manager is. When you place
                your personal needs before your company’s, your purpose becomes apparent. Thus, making you “visible.” This makes YOU the roadblock to your team’s or company’s success. Forget that

              <p class="instruction">Becoming “invisible” means to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Trust other people – place your confidence in other people’s work too</li>
                <li>Give up control – involve your team when making some decisions</li>
                <li>Depend on others – delegate; there is no “I” in the word “team”</li>
                <li>Look at the future – understand how current processes could affect the future of the company negatively</li>
              </ul>
