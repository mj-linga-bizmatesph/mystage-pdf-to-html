            Last month, we lost a big share in the European market. This is because of the complaints we received from
            our clients. We encountered a huge delay in shipping our products to Europe. Our company solved the issue
            last week. So, our customer support started e-mailing our clients about their orders. We are hoping to
            rebuild their trust soon.</p>
