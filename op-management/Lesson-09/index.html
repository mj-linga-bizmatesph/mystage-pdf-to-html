              Our company entered the global market in 1998. Since then, we have
              opened over 5 factories overseas. Our largest customer base is in
              Asia. We will open more offices in the U.S., Europe and Australia
              in the future. For us, communication is important in
              globalization. So, our Japan office would like everyone to study
              English.
