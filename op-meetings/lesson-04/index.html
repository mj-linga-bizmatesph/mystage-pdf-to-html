                As you know, our marketing department has identified a potential market in the area of customized wiring. Our goal is to research its potential and then to create standard procedures
                to handle requests for customization.

                Yes, but up to now, our customization options have been limited because we haven’t had a standard pricing scheme or ordering procedures. <u>Taro, you work in the</u> sales department.
