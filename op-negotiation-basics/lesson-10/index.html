            Discuss the key points you learned in the last four lessons and give
            a few sample expressions.

              The next step in the negotiation process is to build a
              relationship with your counterpart. Make small talk and connect on
              a personal level by saying:
            </p>
            <div class="arrow-part">Please call me Ken.</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              Did you have a hard time finding the building?
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">Okay, let me introduce myself first.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="paper">
            <p>
              Make sure your counterpart understands the purpose of your meeting
              and the agenda. Use the following expressions to help you set your
              goals:
            </p>
            <div class="arrow-part">I'm hoping that we could decide on...</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              I've prepared a simple agenda for today.
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">Is there anything you'd like to add?</div>
          </div>
          <div class="paper">
            <p>
              The more questions you ask, the more information you can get from
              your counterpart. Understand their needs by asking various types
              of questions:
            </p>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              For a general understanding: Can you tell me about...? / Can you
              fill me in on…?
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              For more details: Why…? How…? What…? Where…? When…? Etc.
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              For specific details: Do you…? Did you…? Etc.
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="paper">
            <p>
              It’s always a good idea to check your understanding during the
              negotiation process. Use the following to clarify information:
            </p>
            <div class="arrow-part">So, you‘d like to... Is that correct?</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">Let me check my understanding.</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">So, just to confirm, ...</div>
          </div>
