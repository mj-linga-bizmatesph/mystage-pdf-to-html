            Discuss the key points you learned in the last four lessons and give
            a few sample expressions.

              When presenting your idea, you can follow a simple structure to
              make it easy to understand. You can use phrases like:
            </p>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              Introduce the topic and background: I’d like to talk about...
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              Make your proposal: So I propose that...
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              Highlight the merits: So, this would give your company... (merit)
            </div>

              Expressing agreement is easy. However, saying “yes” all the time
              doesn’t sound natural. Here are some expressions that show
              agreement:
            </p>
            <div class="arrow-part">Yes, I totally agree with you.</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">Yes, I'm fine with that.</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">That makes sense.</div>
          </div>
          <div class="paper">
            <p>
              Sometimes we are afraid to show disagreement because we might
              offend other people. Here are some ways to say “NO” politely and
              professionally:
            </p>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              That's interesting. I'm just concerned about...
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">I have a different view on this.</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              Our priorities might be a bit different. We're thinking of...
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="paper">
            <p>
              Finding common ground is a good way to reach an agreement. Offer
              some options that the other person might agree to. Here are some
              phrases that could help:
            </p>
            <div class="arrow-part">OK, would you agree to...?</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              I'm willing to accept this, if you could consider...
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">What if I..., would you...?</div>
          </div>
