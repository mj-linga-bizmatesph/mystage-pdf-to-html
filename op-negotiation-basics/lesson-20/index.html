              Make sure you go over what you agreed on before ending the
              meeting. Summarize by using the phrases below:
            </p>
            <div class="arrow-part">So we agreed to… (settled items)</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">

              Make sure you end the meeting on a positive note. Show your
              counterpart your appreciation, give some positive feedback, and
              mention the next steps by using the phrases below:
            </p>
            <div class="arrow-part">Thank you for your time today, [name].</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              I’m so glad that we had a chance to share our ideas today.
            </div>

              It’s always a good idea to summarize the terms of your agreement
              in writing. Send a follow-up e-mail by using the following
              expressions:
            </p>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              Thank you for visiting our office yesterday.
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">Just to confirm what we decided,...</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">Here are the next steps...</div>

              You can continue to keep ties with your counterpart even after the
              negotiation by e-mail. Here are some expressions to keep in touch
              with your counterpart in an e-mail:
            </p>
            <div class="arrow-part">I hope you had a nice long weekend.</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">I just wanted to…</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">
              Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
