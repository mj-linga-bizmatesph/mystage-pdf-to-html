              The approach we take in a negotiation is often influenced by our
              personality and background. <br />However, in theory, our approach
              should depend less on who we are and more on how important the
              other side and the outcome are. Select an appropriate approach by:

                I now understand what a negotiation is, but I’m still not sure
                what approach to take with my counterpart. Should I be a tough

                Well, that depends on two things:
                <u>how important the relationship is with your counterpart</u>
                and
                <u>how important the outcome of the negotiation really is.</u>

                Then, you should COMPETE. Take what you can. And if the
                relationship is important, but the outcome isn’t, you should
                ACCOMMODATE. Basically, keep them happy.

                Right. What if both the relationship and the outcome are
                important? Should I COMPROMISE?

                Well, COMPROMISING is a kind of middle ground. Many people
                confuse COMPROMISING with COLLABORATING. They are very
                different. Giving up something is not the same as working
                together. So if both are important, COLLABORATE rather than
                COMPROMISE.
