              The most common reason for negotiations to fail is people issues.
              In effective communication, what’s important is not WHAT is said
              or even HOW it is said, but HOW it is RECEIVED. Avoid people
              issues by:

                human nature to have ill feelings toward someone who disagrees

                <u>alter our tone of voice</u>, and even

                understand the magnitude of the opportunities of working
