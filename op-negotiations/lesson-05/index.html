              Oftentimes in negotiations, we focus too much on what the other side is saying and not enough on why they are saying it. However, to find a solution which satisfies both sides, we need
              to know the real reasons or their interests. Focus on interests by:

                That’s good, but I would go a step further, and

                By asking yourself WHY several times, you’ll begin to see your true interests. And rather than communicating WHAT you want to the other side, sometimes it’s more effective to
                communicate the reason behind it. Then, the other side can understand your real interests.

                I would <u>ask them why they are making such a request</u> or why another request wouldn’t be OK. That’s the essence of win-win negotiations. To really satisfy both sides, you need to
                share each other’s real interests.
