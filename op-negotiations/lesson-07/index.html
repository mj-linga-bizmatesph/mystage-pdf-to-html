              In almost every negotiation, we’re likely to encounter some form
              of conflict. It may be a minor disagreement on an issue or
              complete difference in values. Whatever the case may be, we can
              improve our chances of coming to an agreement by keeping three
              things in mind. Resolve conflict by:

            <tr>
              <td>Ron</td>
              <td>
                I’m sure you’ll disagree on some things. That’s part of
                negotiating.

                Nothing’s wrong with arguing relevant points as long as you
                <u>don’t get personal</u>. Don’t take comments personally and
                don’t make personal attacks. As long as both sides want to reach
                an agreement, conflict is not a bad thing. It’s a chance to
                reach an agreement.

            <tr>

              <td>Ron</td>
              <td>
                It might seem impossible at first. However, if you
                <u>start with areas you can agree on</u>, you’ll slowly build
                trust. And this will encourage both sides to look for ways to
                make it work.

                Right. If we both believe that a solution is possible, we’ll be
                more flexible.

                That’s right. And remember that you can always
                <u>use time to your advantage</u>.

                Sure. The worst thing you can do is rush into a bad decision.
                Sometimes taking a break from the negotiation will open up new
                possibilities.
