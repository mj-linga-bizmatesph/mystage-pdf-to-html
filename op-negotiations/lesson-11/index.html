              According to research, taking the lead from the start of the negotiation allows you to control the entire negotiation process. By taking the lead, you are showing confidence and are more
              likely to be persuasive. Take the lead by:

              <td>So, when is your first meeting with your counterpart?</td>

            <tr>
              <td>Ken</td>
              <td>We haven’t decided yet. I’m waiting for the other side to make the first move. I don’t want to show that we are desperate.</td>

              <td>
                If I were you, I would e-mail your counterpart and show that you are eager to renegotiate your contract. You can say, “<u
                  >I’m writing to set up a meeting to review our contract. After looking over our current arrangement, I feel there are some revisions we can make to better satisfy both sides</u
                >.”

            <tr>
              <td>Ken</td>
              <td>Wow. That’s pretty direct.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ron</td>
              <td>Yes, this shows you are confident and serious. Also, you could say, “<u>I’d be happy to visit your office on any of the following days</u>.”</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ken</td>
              <td>I see. So I decide the venue and just give a few dates and times.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ron</td>
              <td>
                Exactly. And I would suggest an agenda like this: “<u>I’ve put together a draft agenda that we could follow. Please feel free to add any other items</u>.” By taking the lead from the
                start, you’ll be able to control the negotiation. And that’s a big advantage.
