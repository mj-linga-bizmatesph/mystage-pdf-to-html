              Now, you’ve created a positive environment with your counterpart through small talk. The next step is to transition to business talk. A natural flow is to set expectations. You can do
              this by:
            </div>
            <div class="arrow-part">Giving a brief explanation of the background and purpose of the meeting</div>
            <div class="arrow-part">Going over the items on the agenda</div>

          <table>
            <tr>

              <td>
                Well, it’s a good idea to set expectations to make sure that your counterpart is comfortable before moving forward. You can say, “<u
                  >Thank you for making time for me. Our companies have partnered together for 2 years now, and although we’re satisfied with the partnership, we feel there may be some areas that we
                  could still improve</u
                >. <u>So, I hope that we can share ideas and agree on some revisions to benefit both sides</u>.”
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ken</td>
              <td>I see. Then, do I go over the agenda?</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ron</td>
              <td>Yes, you can say, “<u>I’ve prepared an agenda for today</u>. <u>Let me go over the items</u>. <u>First, we can discuss</u>…”</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ken</td>
              <td>That’s good. And then, we can start our discussions?</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ron</td>
              <td>Not yet. It’s a good idea to get their input first. You can say, “<u>Is there anything you’d like to add to the agenda before we begin</u>?”</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ken</td>

            Role play a meeting with your counterpart for a negotiation. Start by creating a positive environment, and then give your counterpart the background and purpose of the negotiation. And
