              It wouldn’t be a negotiation if there was no disagreement. So
              expect to experience resistance from your counterpart somewhere in
              the process. You can deal with it by:

            Ken is speaking to his mentor, Ron, about starting his negotiation.

              <td>
                I understand that conflict is part of the negotiation process,
                but how do I deal with it?

              <td>Ron</td>
              <td>
                Well, first you need to clarify the reason for the conflict.
                Learn more from them. For example, if your counterpart says the
                price is too high, you can ask, “<u
                  >May I ask what you are comparing the price to</u
                >?” This will help you understand his reasoning.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ken</td>
              <td>That makes sense.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ron</td>
              <td>
                And then, you can look for possible options by asking, “<u
                  >Are there any items in the package that you don’t really
                  need</u
                >?” or, “<u>What are the must-haves in this package</u>?”
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ken</td>
              <td>
                Right. So we might be able to change the package so that it’s
                more appropriate to his needs.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ron</td>
              <td>
                Exactly. And you could ask him to come up with a possible
                solution by asking, “<u
                  >What could we do to make this an acceptable package for
                  you</u
                >?”
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Ken</td>
              <td>
                I see. That way my counterpart gets involved in coming up with a
                solution as well.

            Imagine that you and your trainer are planning an event to be held
            in Japan for all trainers and students. You suggest ideas for this
            event, while the trainer resists your ideas. Be sure to clarify the
            reason for resistance, look for other options, and ask for a
            possible solution.
