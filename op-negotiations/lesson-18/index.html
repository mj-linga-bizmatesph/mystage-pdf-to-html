              Now, we’ve come to the most exciting part of the negotiation process, which is closing the deal. However, we need to do more than just agree on the terms in this stage. Close the deal

                Before you do that, ask if all the issues have been resolved. So you can say, “<u>I think we’ve covered all the terms of the contract</u>. <u>Is there anything else to discuss</u>?”

                Then, you can summarize the terms and the benefits to them. You can say, “<u>Let me confirm what we’ve agreed to</u>.” And as you summarize the points, you could add the benefits like
