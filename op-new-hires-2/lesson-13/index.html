                Open-ended questions elicit a more detailed answer. Use open-ended questions when you want to get more information from another person. Here are some examples of open-ended questions:

            Any successful businessperson will tell you the importance of connections in business. Regardless of position, status, age, or field of business, business contacts can help you in your
            work. This is especially true when your contacts are based overseas. The more people you know, the more value you add to yourself and to your company. Therefore, it’s important to see
            every encounter that you have with people as an opportunity to expand your network.

            However, it takes more than an exchange of business cards and a handshake for someone to become your contact. Keeping in touch through social media and e-mail will help develop the
            relationship over time. Also note that the rule of “give and take” should apply. Look for ways to help your contacts and they will be more wiling to help you when the time comes. So, there
            is truth in the saying that “It’s not WHAT you know, but WHO you know”.
