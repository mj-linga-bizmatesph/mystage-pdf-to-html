            A team can be defined as a group of people gathered together working towards a common objective. This means that the company you work for is one big team. Your department is a smaller team
            within a big team. And your section within your department is even a smaller team. The point is that you need to be a team player if you work for a company.

            Teamwork means understanding the team objectives and your role in order to achieve the objectives. A mistake on your part affects the success of the entire team. And a team member facing
            trouble is your problem as well. With these points in mind, it makes sense to not only ask for but to offer help when needed.
