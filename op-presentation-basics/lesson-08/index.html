                    Our recent performance in Malaysia has been very good.

                    our performance domestically hasn’t been so positive.
                    <span class="u"> Therefore</span>, it’s necessary for us to
                    focus more on the Malaysian market.
                    <span class="u">In addition,</span>
                    we should look into other potential Asian markets similar to
                    Malaysia.

                    The last project was a big success.
                    <span class="u">However</span>, we did have a few problems.
                    Our manufacturing line is fairly old.
                    <span class="u">Moreover,</span>
                    we need access to more skilled labor.

                    I suggest we find a partner to help us with these
