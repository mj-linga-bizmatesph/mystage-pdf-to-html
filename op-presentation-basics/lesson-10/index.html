                    The way something is presented is just as important as the
                    content. To make your presentation impactful, consider these
                    points:
                  </p>
                  <div class="arrow-part">
                    <b>Gestures:</b> Use your hands and body to make certain
                    points more impactful.

                  <div class="arrow-part">
                    <b>Voice:</b> Vary your speed, tone, and stress to keep the
                    audience interested.

                  <div class="arrow-part">

                    engaged.
