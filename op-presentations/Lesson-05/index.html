              Let me start by giving you some information about MMB Corp. MMB was founded in 1927 by Junpei Shinoda.
              <span class="highlight">How many people have heard of Junpei Shinoda? Please raise your hand. Not very many</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was an engineering genius. He had worked in the US and could speak English very well.
              <span class="highlight">Imagine 80 years ago when very few people in Japan had ever been overseas, he was studying in the US.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1952, his son, Kotaro, took over the company. <span class="highlight">And how big is the company now?</span> Now with over 2000 employees in Japan, China, Malaysia, and Vietnam, MMB
              Corp is one of the top electrical wiring companies in Japan.
