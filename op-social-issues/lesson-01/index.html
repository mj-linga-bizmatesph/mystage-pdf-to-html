          <p class="introduction">
            In some developed countries, life expectancy is continuing to increase while birth rates are on a decline. Though many support advancements in technology and medicine, some may view an
            overly aged society as a sign of troubling times ahead.

              I have nothing but the <span class="pink">utmost</span> respect for my elders. However, something has to be said about the kind of impact they’re having on health care and welfare costs.
              It wouldn’t be so bad if we had more young people to support the aged, but that just isn’t the case. I don’t have any answers, but I’m worried about how the government is going to handle
              it.

              There’s one thing in this world that doesn’t discriminate and that’s time. We all age equally. Now that I’m in my <span class="pink">golden years</span>, I’d like to believe that the
              society I contributed so much to has the decency to support an old man. Sure it’s inconvenient and expensive, but when you get to my age, every little bit helps.

            Many would agree that the contributions the elderly have made to our communities over the course of their lives is nothing short of extraordinary. Though costs are an
            <span class="pink">inevitable</span> part of the discussion, most would agree that no price is too steep when it comes to the lives of those we care about.
