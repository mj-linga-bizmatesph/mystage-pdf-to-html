          <p class="introduction">
            In capitalist societies, one’s worth is often associated with material wealth. Although the value of a person cannot be determined by wealth alone, it is an undeniable fact that many view
            money as power.

              I’ve always been brought up with the <span class="pink">notion</span> that I am what I wear. There is truth in what they say about being able to tell a lot about a person by their watch
              and shoes. In my society, status is everything. If you have money and position, you can do and have anything.

              I hate that money is <span class="pink">the be-all and end-all</span>. The only way to advance as a species is to move past our petty individualistic ambitions and strive towards greater
              harmony and compassion. The blind pursuit of money divides us, creates conflict, and causes more harm than good.

          <p class="introduction">
            Status and wealth are powerful influences in modern society. It is a master key for some, and an <span class="pink">unscalable</span> wall for others. Although it’s easy to put a price on
            goods, there are some things in life that can’t be so easily bought.
