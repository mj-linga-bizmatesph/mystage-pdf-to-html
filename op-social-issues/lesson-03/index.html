            In our globalized world, immigration has become the focal point of many debates and political platforms. As a result, many nations are now expected to
            <span class="pink">confront</span> the reality that an open-door policy may be the only way to meaningful growth.

              I don’t <span class="pink">have anything against</span> other peoples and cultures, but I personally prefer to look after our own. There are reasons why we’ve become such a powerful
              nation, and I don’t think bringing in more and more immigrants and refugees will do us any good. I say keep them out, and let’s protect our own people and interests.

              Growth has never come from maintaining the <span class="pink">status quo</span>. This includes immigration. A community that leverages the strengths of various peoples and cultures is
              stronger than one that doesn’t. There is strength in diversity, and compassion in making those different from us become our neighbors.

            There is no easy answer when it comes to protecting national interests. However, the <span class="pink">irrefutable</span> fact remains that the world’s greatest resource isn’t oil, gas,
            or precious metals, but rather the people that inhabit it and the talent they possess.
