            One’s appearance is viewed as either an advantage or a disadvantage. In a world obsessed with appearance, one may believe beauty is an advantage worth having. Fortunately or unfortunately,

            Is beauty a blessing or a curse? Some view it as a key to all the doors, whereas others see it as a <span class="pink">veil</span> that keeps people from seeing beneath the surface.
