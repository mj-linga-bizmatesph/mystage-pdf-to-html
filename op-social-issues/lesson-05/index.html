            One may be surprised to know that in a city of millions, there are many that feel like they just don’t belong. As a result, many seek isolation where there is no one to judge,
            <span class="pink">mock</span>, or criticize. Society can be a cold place, and sometimes, stepping out the door requires more courage than some expect.

              words, they always come out awkward, strange, and I look like a <span class="pink">freak</span>. I’m trying really hard, but I’m just so nervous all the time. I just want people to

            need to be liked by others often drives us to do the things we do, the things we don’t, and the things we wish we could.
