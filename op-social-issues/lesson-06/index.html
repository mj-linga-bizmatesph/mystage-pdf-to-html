            Some believe that age is just a number – an <span class="pink">arbitrary</span> figure meant to represent experience, knowledge, and potential. However true that may be, we can all agree
            that age is less about how we appear and more about how we feel.

              My body aches, my bones <span class="pink">creak</span>, and my memory isn’t as good as it used to be, but I sure don’t feel like slowing down. It feels strange that I have more energy
              in my old age than when I was a young man at the office. I wish people could see that. All they notice now are the grey hairs and wrinkles…but I am more.

            There are old souls in young bodies and passionate youth in the aged. Although age reflects the number of years one has been alive, it is a poor measure of the
            <span class="pink">infinite</span> complexities of the human spirit.
