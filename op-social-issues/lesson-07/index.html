          <p class="introduction">
            For many young people, the idea of a lifetime career is an idea from a <span class="pink">bygone era</span>. More and more people are starting to consider job hopping the norm and an
            effective way of boosting experience, connections, and compensation. However, some still view this behavior as something less than appealing.

              I could never stay in one place for more than a few years, max. It’s not that I didn’t like my jobs, it’s just that I felt I learned all I could and it was time to move on and
              <span class="pink">jump ship</span>. I’m like a shark, I gotta keep moving or I’ll die. I look at people doing the same thing for years and years and years and I wonder to myself, why?

              In society there are a few things that really matter. One of them is loyalty. Loyalty to your family, your friends, and to your job. That is a sign of a responsible person. I’m not sure
              why people are jumping around like rabbits. I’ve always been told to <span class="pink">stay the course</span>, and that’s what I’ve done with every aspect of my life. And I’m proud of
              that.

          <p class="introduction">
            Many would agree that one’s career plays a huge role in defining who they are as people. Although one may be defined by their career choice, we can all agree that sometimes, we all need a
            <span class="pink">change of pace</span>, and finding oneself often requires a few, if not many, changes.
