            When our values go against the grain, we face conflict not only within ourselves but also all around us. However, it is within this conflict that we are able to determine who we really
            are, what matters most, and the strength of our resolve.

              If everyone ran around doing whatever they wanted, it’d be chaos. It’s because of our laws and cultural norms that we are able to live in such a peaceful society. We don’t always get
              what we want, but it’s that kind of sacrifice that makes us responsible adults who can contribute to our society and the greater good.

              It’s not that I feel I don’t belong, it’s just that I want to be more. I look around me and I see…sheep – people bound by customs and mindsets forced upon them by a society too slow and
              rigid to change. If we want to reach our full potential as individuals, we need to question things, challenge our surroundings, and expand our horizons.

          <p class="introduction">
            The struggle to define oneself is a journey that can take a lifetime of experience. Though some may feel they are being suffocated by overwhelming societal pressures, one is often defined
            by their reaction to their environment and their ability or inability to find their voice in the crowd.
