            Education and standardized testing have traditionally gone hand in hand, with the latter being viewed as the most effective way of measuring progress, ability, and potential. However,
            there is a <span class="pink">far cry</span> between standardized tests and reality, and one may wonder if current methods are doing more harm than good.

              In no way should a single test <span class="pink">make or break</span> a child’s future. Learning and growing is a process that is too complex to be determined by a series of tests, and
              we should be aware of this as educators and as parents. Intelligence can reveal itself in many ways, not only in the form of scores. We just need to know where and how to look.

              If I can <span class="pink">ace this test</span> and get into this school, my life is set. If I can’t, my life is over, and I might as well just scrub toilets for the rest of my life.
              That’s how it is. So, I learn what they tell me to learn, study what they tell me to study, and memorize as much as I can. There’s not much room for anything else.

          <p class="introduction">
            Though many believe in the evidence that standardized testing provides, human intelligence and potential cannot be so easily defined. Many attribute success to one’s performance under
            pressure, but some view standardized testing as an unfair <span class="pink">snapshot</span> of one’s capacity for great achievements.
