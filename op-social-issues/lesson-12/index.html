            Many consider love to be one of life’s greatest pursuits, yet one of life’s biggest challenges. It’s an uphill battle littered with the <span class="pink">disillusioned</span> and broken
            hearted, yet the pain of failure is a risk many are willing to take regardless of age, gender, or nationality.

              My daughter said she’s <span class="pink">fallen for</span> a foreigner. How can you love someone so different from your own people? Can’t she find someone from the same country? Sure,
              he might be a nice person, but I am worried for her. It’s important that we keep our family together and she marry into a good, local family. I won’t allow it.

              Her mother is <span class="pink">dead set against</span> us being together. Why? I know it’s not so simple, but why interfere with and complicate something as pure as love? Shouldn’t
              her daughter's happiness be the most important factor? I know I’m not perfect, but I know I’d be a wonderful husband. I wish her mother would give me a chance.

          <p class="introduction">
            Relationships, marriages, family, and acceptance have never been easy things. Though one may hope that love <span class="pink">transcends</span> all boundaries, the success of any
            relationship isn’t solely dependent on the couple’s efforts alone but also on the support of those around them.
