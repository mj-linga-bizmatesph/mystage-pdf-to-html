            Technology continues to progress at <span class="pink">breakneck speeds</span>, fundamentally changing the way we behave, think, and communicate as a species. With no limit in sight, one
            must wonder if the impact of technology has been entirely positive.

              as we can biologically. The only real way for us to grow now is through the further integration of human life and technology.

              not about quantity, it’s about quality. When was the last time you actually called someone to say hi? Technology has somehow managed to isolate us from each other.

          <p class="introduction">
            From the wheel to the smartphone, technology’s role in shaping the human race is irrefutable. As things continue to advance, it may be necessary to remember that even though technology as
            a tool is undeniably powerful - technology as a <span class="pink">crutch</span> may be inevitably disastrous.
