            There are moments when one is called to act. There isn’t the luxury of time or the reassurance of safety, but a <span class="pink">volatile</span> situation that could quickly worsen if no
            one does anything. Does one allow this to become someone else’s responsibility, or take matters into their own hands?

              worth the trouble. I have no intention of being more than I am. If it doesn’t directly involve me, I’ll look the other way. I need to worry about myself.

              If there’s a bad situation, it’s up to someone to do something. It’s the <span class="pink">inaction</span> of good people that is part of the problem. Sure, it’s scary. Sure, it might
              be nothing. But I would feel terrible if something did happen. These are the moments that define who we are, and I would rather act than run.

          <p class="introduction">
            For many, the fear of acting is influenced by many factors: the seriousness of the incident, the consequences of one’s <span class="pink">intervention</span>, or other people’s reaction to
            the situation. No matter how it is perceived, the only question that matters is, what are you going to do about it?
