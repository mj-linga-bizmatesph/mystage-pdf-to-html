          <p class="introduction">
            More and more people in developed societies are choosing not to have children. The costs, commitment, and changes associated with parenthood are serious barriers that make many wonder if
            having children is really worth the <span class="pink">sacrifice</span>.

              All my life I’ve been an independent person, doing what I want, when I want. I have a dream of my future and it simply doesn’t involve me being a mother. It’s not that I don’t like
              children, but I want to be in control of what I do with my own life. I don’t want to lose the ability to…just go. I need <span class="pink">spontaneity</span> and spark more than I need
              kids.

              I’ve always wanted kids. In today’s world, people want more money, want more time, want more everything. But I’d give it up <span class="pink">in a heartbeat</span> so I can watch my
              children eat ice cream for the first time, teach my son how to talk to girls, or watch my baby grow up to be a strong, beautiful woman. I need my life to be more than just being about
              me.

          <p class="introduction">
            Having a family and <span class="pink">child rearing</span> have never been easy tasks. It’s a lifetime commitment that requires much more than just time and money. As a result, some may
            be more suited for parenthood than others, yet whatever choice one makes, we are all responsible for our own happiness.
