            As social creatures, we have the need to identify with and belong to social groups. Although this group mentality eventually provides a sense of belonging, it also results in the
            <span class="pink">vilifying</span>
            of those that are different and the inciting of conflict where there was once just the desire to belong.

              I moved around a lot, growing up. It was <span class="pink">rough</span> always being the new kid, but I learned a lot about people and how to fit in quickly. One thing I can say for
              sure is that people love to love the same things…but love to hate the same things even more. Strange how people need to feed that part of themselves.

              We are a million different people pulling in a million different directions. We need conflict to give us direction and focus. We need enemies and rivals to push and drive us. Whether
              that be another person, company, or country, conflict has always been humanity’s most effective <span class="pink">motivator</span>.

          <p class="introduction">
            Humans are inherently social, yet <span class="pink">relentlessly</span> self-destructive and ironically selective in our inclusiveness. Though there is growth in conflict, so too is there
            value in realizing that we are far more similar than we are different. We are, after all, human.
