            The <span class="pink">advent</span> of social media has resulted in the creation of an entirely new subset of professions and celebrities. Likes, views, followers, shares, subscribers,
            and comments have become highly sought-after commodities that are defining a generation and changing the way we interact with our world.

              It’s cool being able to connect with people. If my post gets to you, <span class="pink">resonates with</span> you, and you like it, it’s the best feeling in the world. It’s great having
              a platform that lets me share my thoughts and content with the world. I think we’ve all got something we want to say, so say it loud and get it out there! Make yourself heard!

              There are serious problems associated with social media. More and more people feel the need to <span class="pink">validate</span> their lives on SNS. This results in depression and
              unrealistic standards. Social media has destroyed relationships, ruined careers, brought dangerous people together, and we all use it without really understanding the dangers or
              consequences.

          <p class="introduction">
            The ability to communicate, connect, and exchange ideas with people from around the world is truly powerful. Though arguments can be made for both sides, how one chooses to use social
            media and for what purpose will ultimately determine whether it has contributed to, or <span class="pink">detracted from</span>, society.
