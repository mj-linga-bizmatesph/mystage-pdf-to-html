          <p class="introduction">
            As a society, we look to newspapers, television programs, and <span class="pink">clean-cut</span> anchors to deliver news we deem trustworthy. The unfortunate reality is that truth comes
            at a cost. And sometimes, the cost is more than some are willing to pay.

              People believe whatever is being said in the media without a second thought. That is the most dangerous kind of <span class="pink">ignorance</span>; the kind that is viewed as informed.
              I’m not some crazy conspiracy theorist, but I think we can all agree there’s power in information, and more importantly, misinformation.

              I’m okay with <span class="pink">Big Brother</span> filtering the news that gets out to the masses. There’s a lot of information out there that could do more harm than good. They’re the
              Government for a reason, and I believe they have our best interests at heart. I live a simple life. I don’t need to know everything.

          <p class="introduction">
            In a world filled with political, personal, and economic <span class="pink">agendas</span>, it’s difficult to know what to believe. However, by staying informed, asking the right
            questions, and discussing the issues with various people we can ensure that we remain properly informed and truly aware.
