            It has been said that working professionals spend a third of their lives at the office. It comes as no surprise then that many find balancing their private lives and professional careers
            challenging, <span class="pink">daunting</span>, and near impossible to achieve.

              My biggest responsibility is to my family, and as ironic as it may sound, that is why I work sixty hours a week. True, I don’t get to see them as much as I would like, but we

            Balance is important in all aspects of life. Too much of any one thing can be <span class="pink">detrimental</span> to one’s health and happiness. Though professional obligations are often
            prioritized over more personal commitments, productivity has been closely linked with successful work-life balance.
