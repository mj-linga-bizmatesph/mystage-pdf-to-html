          <p class="introduction">
            There are many topics that are viewed as being too sensitive, risky, and difficult to discuss openly. However, the most meaningful conversations, the ones that form our
            <span class="pink">worldview</span>, lead to growth and define who we are, are often the most difficult to have.

              There are so many topics I’m curious about, so many things I don’t understand. I just don’t know how I should bring them up. There are a lot of issues I’m
              <span class="pink">mum on</span> because I’m afraid I’m going to offend someone, but isn’t this going to make things worse? Issues like politics, religion, and gender identity affect
              millions, and I shouldn’t even talk about it…

              It’s a <span class="pink">minefield</span> out there. There’s a lot more at risk than just one person’s idea of social justice. Being politically correct and knowing how to play it safe
              are good things. Humans can be emotional, volatile, and easy to offend. Though we hope for the best in people, the truth is, there are no guarantees. Better safe than sorry, right?

          <p class="introduction">
            Fear of sensitive topics, inopportunity, and <span class="pink">complacency</span> result in many misunderstandings, conflicts, and damaged relationships. However, when mutual
            understanding and respect are valued over individualistic agendas, the path forward doesn’t seem as risky as one may have initially believed.
